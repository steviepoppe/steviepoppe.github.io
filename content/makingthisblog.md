I've been thinking on maintaining a blog for a while now and had already stacked up a pile of writings ready to post. I just needed the time to sit down and get started on the technicalities: a perfect fit for my long summer break. This blog serves not as a tutorial on making one with Pelican (the internet is abound with those[^1][^2]), but as a log on my thought process during creation.

From the getgo I tried to steer away from heavy management systems such as drupal or wordpress. They're easy to work with and take a lot of work of your hands, but a serverside database means a too heavy load for what's basically a smallscale personal blog, and several unnecessary security risks on top. The tech-hipster in me opted for a DIY approach, and as I'm partial to python and it's usage in the scientific and academic world, I ended up choosing for Pelican (the relatively new kid on the block static blog framework wise) over the ruby-based Jekyll. The added value on managing my blogs clientside and delivering small sized static pages is the ease of finding an appropriate host (I host everything on github) and a seamless integration in my markdown-based writing workflow.

Having some free time on my hands and the urge of polishing up my rusty design skills, I spent some time getting acquainted with the Jinja2 theme framework and the various pelican plugins while designing the current layout (a heavily modified [Plumage](https://github.com/kdeldycke/plumage) theme). I prefer a minimalistic layout easy on the eye, and steered clear of unnecessary clutter, but ended up integrating banners in my posts as research has proven these to catch one's attention more easily. Using Twitter's bootstrap3 ensured me I could provide a responsive page for handheld devices too.

Setting up a basic framework is as easy as it comes, involving just a few commandline commands, but
