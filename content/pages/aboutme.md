# #About me

Hello! I'm Stevie, a Belgian student at the University of Leuven. This page serves as a brief biographical introduction, as well as explaining the aims of this blog.

Having formerly attained a BA in Applied Informatics,[^1] I'm currently pursuing a degree in Japanology at the University of Leuven; a radical switch, but one through which I'm able to combine both my strong interest in humanities as in the country of Japan. Growing up in a poor Antwerp neighbourhood as the only kid at school of a supposed Belgian origin, and later onwards as a technical school (TSO) student, I have seen, and been confronted with, all kinds of discrimination. This has led me to an interest in (and questioning of) the notion of national identity and nationalism itself, as well as more broadly, an interest in the fields of sociology and politics. That aside, I've become particularly drawn to Digital Humanities, a domain that feels, through several years of fostering technical skills, right at home as a perfect synthesis of both my former and current studies.

On a personal note, I'm fairly passionate about music. I've spent the better part of my life taking piano classes or playing in bands, and despite an ever shrinking lack of free time, enjoy spending most of it on composing. 

This blog serves as a platform for random musings on personal subjects (I also hope to occasionally plug whatever music I'm working on!) as well as a means to hone my linguistic proficiency. That aside, I hope I'll be able to provide some assistence to my fellow students (or anyone interested) on technical aspects related to the academic studies.

# #This blog

I host my blog, built on the extremely versatile and lightweight Pelican framework, on github pages, using a custom made jinja2 template based on the [nest](https://github.com/molivier/nest) and [plumage](https://github.com/kdeldycke/plumage) templates. As my workflow involves writing most of my papers in markdown syntaxis anyway (I'm trying to incorporate a "less is more" attitude wherever possible), Pelican turns out to be both a good match and way for me to maintain my webdesign skills.
