This page contains links and files that have proven to be particularly useful for myself and might be of use for those with similar interests. I'll update this spot as I encounter more tools or pages I feel are worthy of mention.

#Useful Links

## General

* **[Anki](http://ankisrs.net/)**: Free, opensource, multiplatform (smartphones included) flashcard application with powerful SRS[^1] algorithm. Especially vital for language acquisition and probably the single most important tool for efficient memorisation. 

##Language

### Japanese

* **[Rikaisama](#)**: a Firefox[^2] extension on [Rikaichan](https://addons.mozilla.org/nl/firefox/addon/rikaichan/), a pop-up dictionary and a digital minded Japanese learner's best friend. Rikaisama allows additional audio playback anki integration. I've written a [blog](#) on how to do this.
* **[Animelon](http://animelon.com/)**: for all you 'learn Japanese through Anime' kids out there! Reminiscent of the classic *[Erin's Challenge](https://www.erin.ne.jp/en/)* videos: watch various popular anime with japanese subtitles in kanji/kana/romaji and a script with integrated dictionary as sidebar. Perfect in combination with rikaisama as well.
* **[Waran Jiten](http://japansnederlandswoordenboek.org/index.php/Hoofdpagina)**: a Japanese-Dutch dictionary courtesy of Leuven University. Has a dutch rikai addon.
* **[Tangorin](http://tangorin.com/kanji/)**: my favorite online Japanese dictionary, has an excellent Kanji dictionary as well.
* **[Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/directory/home-education/edlanguage/os:windows/?q=Japanese)**: contains a wide variety of software developed by fellow Japanese learners. Some, such as *Jnovelformatter* and *Japanese Text Analysis Tool* (both which I've discussed [here](#) and [here](#)) are particularly noteworthy, others not so much.
* **[KULeuven Japanology](http://japanologie.arts.kuleuven.be/)**: the Leuven University Japanology homepage. <i class="icon-smile"></i>

###Sanskrit

* **[spokensanskrit](http://spokensanskrit.de/)**: the only decent online Sanskrit dictionary out there.
* **[Lexilogos](http://www.lexilogos.com/keyboard/sanskrit_devanagari.htm)**: multilingual web keyboard that beats learning to type devanagari on a latin-script keyboard.

# Files

## Anki

I use Anki to compliment my other study methods for nearly all my classes. These are a bunch of ankisets I made I feel are stand-alone enough to be useful to new students of these classes as well.

### Inleiding tot de Europese Literatuur na 1750

* **Download**: [Europese Literatuur <i class="icon-download-alt"></i>]({filename}/files/Europese_literatuur.apkg)

A full set to accompany the textbook '*Literaire Verbeelding 2*'[^3]: contains important dates and summaries of all artists and their discussed works (in Dutch), sorted by period (from Romanticism till Postmodernism).

### Kanji 2

* **Download**: [Kanji 2 <i class="icon-download-alt"></i>]({filename}/files/Kanji_2.apkg) [Kanji Vocab 2 <i class="icon-download-alt"></i>]({filename}/files/Kanji_woordenschat_2.apkg)

Two sets on the compulsory kanji and vocabulary for kanji/goi classes in the 2nd year of Japanology, as seen in our handbook[^4] lessons 1 - 20. They're tagged by chapter and contain respectively strokeorder, radicals, definitions, and different readings for the Kanji set, and example sentences in cloze deletion[^5] for vocab, both in recognition and reproduction form. They use the KanjiStrokeOrders[^6] font and display hidden hiragana on touch/hover.
