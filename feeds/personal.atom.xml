&lt;p&gt;Friday, 16 August 2019, approximately 2PM and approximately 2 hours of sleep. Calling that day a somewhat surreal and emotionally taxing day, might, in retrospect, be putting it mildly. I had just spent the night proofreading my graduate thesis for the thousandth time, buried in anxiety that a minor typo in a footnote still buried somewhere on the tenth page of my appendix would destroy my chances of graduation. Within the timespan of barely an hour, I retrieved the print copies of said thesis at a local print shop, handed them in at my university, shared a cup of coffee with some of my classmates—by now, my good friends—at &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; local coffeehouse hangout, checked my watch, and rushed towards the train-station. I had a flight to China to catch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the unwarranted stress, my five years as both undergraduate and graduate student at KU Leuven—enrolling at this university must have been the single most transformative decision I have ever taken—were now definitely at an end. To ‘celebrate’, I would now partake in a graduation trip to mainland China, accompanied by some of my closest friends while living in Japan. Both literally and figuratively a graduation trip, this trip was simultaneously a finale to my student life at KU Leuven, to my period of living in Japan, and to my youth in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A finale written by a director of slice-of-life situational comedy, that is; while contemplating all the above at the airport, a stoic voice announced that my flight was canceled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id="itinerary"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#itinerary"&gt;Itinerary &lt;i class="icon-plane small-font"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My initial plan was to take the plane to Hong Kong, spend the afternoon hanging out with a friend in Tsim Sha Tsui, and take a late evening train straight to Changsha, my initial destination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, after my initial flight was canceled and making my connection in time seemed increasingly unlikely, I received a new itinerary to Changsha through connecting flights in the Netherlands and Shanghai. I would have to wait approximately seven more hours in the airport of Amsterdam, but I’ve had worse experiences and I could just take a nap after checking in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or so I thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of hours afterwards I was informed that my flight to Shanghai was canceled. Instead, I was offered a direct flight to Changsha from Frankfurt, Germany the next day as well as a free stay in a nearby hotel. Oh well. Heading towards …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">

&lt;p&gt;My initial plan was to take the plane to Hong Kong, spend the afternoon hanging out with a friend in Tsim Sha Tsui, and take a late evening train straight to Changsha, my initial destination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, after my initial flight was canceled and making my connection in time seemed increasingly unlikely, I received a new itinerary to Changsha through connecting flights in the Netherlands and Shanghai. I would have to wait approximately seven more hours in the airport of Amsterdam, but I’ve had worse experiences and I could just take a nap after checking in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or so I thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of hours afterwards I was informed that my flight to Shanghai was canceled. Instead, I was offered a direct flight to Changsha from Frankfurt, Germany the next day as well as a free stay in a nearby hotel. Oh well. Heading towards the exit, I even met some familiar faces. For several weeks during the end of June and early August, I assisted a team of Kyoto University scholars in digitizing Edo-era Ukiyo-e woodblock prints at the Brussels Royal Museum of Arts. Turns out they took a detour in the Netherlands and were heading to the United States from Amsterdam Airport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although at the time of boarding it turned out there was some data mismatch with my rescheduled flight, it was, at least, sorted out in time to like, actually let me board. The flight to Changsha was quite pleasant, though, and I even ended up playing a couple of rounds of &lt;em&gt;Xiangqi&lt;/em&gt; (“Chinese chess”) with the guy sitting next to me, a Chinese student living in Germany.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1" id="fnref-1" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immigration and passport control was no doubt by the far the most strict I have ever experienced, but generally speaking, there were no further hiccups and,&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2" id="fnref-2" rel="footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; after meeting up with friends at the airport our trip was good to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="changsha"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#changsha"&gt;Changsha (长沙市)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/49531766821/in/album-72157713097960397/" title="Sky"&gt;&lt;img alt="Sky" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49531766821_e9228a9d75_z.jpg" style="width: 45%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="center border" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/49531994597/in/album-72157713097960397/" title="Changsha"&gt;&lt;img alt="Changsha" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49531994597_210b7d8e6b_z.jpg" style="width: 45%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calling Changsha, the capital of Hunan (湖南) Province, a tourist-friendly destination is a bit of stretch, and for most foreign tourists, the city and its airport will serve primarily as layover. Changsha downtown in particular has a bit of an industrious, developing atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was particularly obvious when our friend guided us to a local private cinema place; for a handful of yuen per person (the equivalent of about $2), we had access to a room with a large reclining sofa, HD beamer and a large selection of movies, which was quite comfortable where it not for a handful of cockroaches in our vicinity. The building itself had seen better days, and aside from one employee it felt as if we were the only people there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="changsha" class="hwimportant border fcenter" src="https://steviepoppe.net/images/china/20190821_004130.jpg" title="changsha"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or when we, deciding on Karaoke, found a nearby place in another worn down building—the guard at the front fast asleep—, took the elevator to one of the top floors and ended up at what appeared to be an intense fight. We heard glass break as soon as the elevator doors opened, and promptly entered a strange scene of drunk, shirtless men shouting and waving billiard cues around, someone hiding behind a counter, and dark smoke rising from the corner. For a second everyone stared at us, most likely wondering what a white, western tourist was doing at 2AM in a downtown karaoke, and we solemnly took that silence as a cue to make our departure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such initial impressions aside (that wouldn’t apply to the usual foreign tourist either way), Changsha had its share of vibrant urban life with some lovely, scenic hot spots such as the surroundings of Hunan University (near a massive statue of Mao Zedong—Mao was born in a nearby village),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having lived in Japan, even in an international metropolis such as Tokyo, I was more accustomed to standing out and being either approached, avoided or stared at due to being foreign-looking. Even then, I was not prepared for how much elevated this would be during my trip and stay in Changsha in particular; I can’t recall how many times I have heard the terms 外国人 (wàiguórén) or 老外 (lǎowài), both more or less meaning foreigner, or was cautiously approached by children wanting to practice what they had learned at their English classes. On a side note, me and friends communicate in Japanese, which, while culturally possibly insensitive, was unavoidable. On one of the scenic spots, a young and male group of local Chinese tourists were making comments about us akin to “Why is that Japanese girl with a white guy and why does he speak Japanese” and “Tss, Japanese women are so cheap”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh - and this counts for other regions in China as well -, I highly recommend looking into local food delivery and uber-style transport services; they are both reliant and cost-effective, and for non-locals a more ideal way of getting around rather than figuring out each local public transport system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="yunnan"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#yunnan"&gt;Yunnan (云南省)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/49531266768/in/album-72157713097960397/" title="Ricefields"&gt;&lt;img alt="Ricefields" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49531266768_001329491b_z.jpg" style="width: 45%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="center border" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/49531263363/in/album-72157713097960397/" title="Industry"&gt;&lt;img alt="Industry" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49531263363_9b1b0650d2_z.jpg" style="width: 45%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our next destination was Kunming, the capital of Yunnan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the first things that hit on arrival me was the drastic difference in climate compared to Changsha. Although separated only by one province in-between, the temperature in Changsha was at that time of the year unbearably hot to the point we could barely engage in outdoor activities during day-time, whereas the high altitude of Kunming and Yunnan in general provided a very pleasant, temperate climate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, despite stereotypes of air pollution in China, the air around Kunming and the other places of Yunnan we visited was surprisingly clean, often with crystal clear blue skies befitting the time of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="kunming"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#kunming"&gt;Kunming (昆明市)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="kunming" class="hwimportant border fcenter" src="https://steviepoppe.net/images/china/20190824_200819.jpg" title="kunming"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the central areas of Kunming were particularly vibrant, with a lovely youthful vibrant vibe. My friends introduced me to their university, famed for its focus on Chinese ethnic minorities, anthropology and cultural studies, as well as the surrounding parks, the nearby shopping districts Wenhua Alley and Qianju street, Daguan Park and Guandu Old Town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the lovely weather, the park were filled with people enjoying a walk or performing music. Mahjong tables drew formidable crowds of elderly people commenting on in progress games, and other parts of the park drew rows of people stretching, dancing an exercising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spicy dishes recommended to me in Changsha were right up my alley but the food I’ve eaten here was personally at an entirely different level. The mushroom hotpot was by far one of the best things I have ever eaten, and I’m not overreacting when I say I would definitely consider a detour back to Kunming next time I’m in China, purely to enjoy its taste again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/49531766276/in/album-72157713097960397/" title="Kunming"&gt;&lt;img alt="Kunming" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49531766276_c495a542ab_z.jpg" style="width: 45%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="center border" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/49531267993/in/album-72157713097960397/" title="Kunming"&gt;&lt;img alt="Kunming" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49531267993_9792b80954_z.jpg" style="width: 45%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting sight I would’ve liked to capture on photo was the juxtaposition of a young, fashionable girl, taking a selfie in front of a historical Socialist-era statue celebrating the working class, situated right in front of feudal-era Qing dynasty architecture: a fascinating micro-representation of a layered society with clear elements of three distinctly different modes of production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/49531993912/in/album-72157713097960397/" title="One step forward"&gt;&lt;img alt="One step forward" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49531993912_56c5aa55eb_z.jpg" style="height:500px;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;『向前一小步、文明一大步』 - &lt;del&gt;Neil Armstrong&lt;/del&gt; Famous Toilet Proverb&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a side note, this plate found around public restrooms was quite comical; translating to something akin to “One small step for man, one giant leap forward towards civilization”, a polite way of asking men to stand closer to the urinals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lijiang"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#lijiang"&gt;Lijiang (丽江市)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lijiang, the nearby Dali and Shangri-la are historical towns near the border of Sichuan and Tibet, popular among in-land tourists for the natural beauty of its surrounding mountains and the architectural traditions of the various ethnic minorities inhabiting these regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/49531266533/in/album-72157713097960397/" title="Lijiang"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lijiang" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49531266533_32f0eaf419_z.jpg" style="width: 45%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="center border" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/49531991062/in/album-72157713097960397/" title="Lijiang"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lijiang" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49531991062_c08ed9a320_z.jpg" style="width: 45%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without exaggeration the old town of Lijiang and the hotel we were staying at are among the most beautiful places I’ve visited in my life. The historical center is particularly lively even in the late evening, with daily bonfires and dancing; but the nearby Black Dragon Pool made for a perfect breathing space. One particular height of our stay was an afternoon of horse riding along the Jade Dragon Snow Mountain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I must admit is that the high altitude of the region takes a while to get used to and is fairly draining; leaving us absolutely exhausted after a full day out and a long climb up back to our hotel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/49531768256/in/album-72157713097960397/" title="Lijiang"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lijiang" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49531768256_c2ee5b07c7_z.jpg" style="width: 45%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="center border" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/49531265048/in/album-72157713097960397/" title="Lijiang"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lijiang" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49531265048_9a45da7355_z.jpg" style="width: 45%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon arrival at the airport we were informed that our flight would be delayed by about five hours. While several people were noticeably aggravated, others took the news more calmly: one guy took out his jump rope and started exercising in the middle of the hallway. Another guy, a local musician practicing acoustic guitar, upon noticing me walked over and asked me to join him. To be fair, it was clear he was more interested in taking pictures together to post on social media, but it was a nice way of passing and he helped me out afterwards by sharing his 4G hot spot when I needed to make a phone call (passengers would receive a small financial compensation for the delay, which was to be deposited on our personal WePay account, which I as a foreigner did not have).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of our late arrival in Xi’an I was unable to leave the airport and find a place to stay so I used part of the financial compensation to rent a small cabin with a couch at the airport instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="xian-shaanxi"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#xian-shaanxi"&gt;Xi’an, Shaanxi (西安市，陕西省)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/49531990632/" title="Xi’an"&gt;&lt;img alt="Xi’an" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49531990632_7b826d4fa4_z.jpg" style="height:480px; width:500px;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xi’an, the capital of Shaanxi Province, is famed worldwide for its rich history as the historic capital of China for about a millennium of its existence, and for its international importance in the era of the Silk Road. Of particular fame are the Terracotta Warriors, an in-progress excavation site containing an impressive army of around 2,000 incredibly detailed and life-like statues of armed soldiers and horses. The site has become one of China’s major tourist attractions and a main staple of guided tours throughout the country. Aside from a couple of exceptions in Lijiang, it was my first time being confronted with other western tourists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/49531264923/in/album-72157713097960397/" title="Xi’an"&gt;&lt;img alt="Xi’an" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49531264923_312da1bb26_z.jpg" style="width: 45%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="center border" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/49531765246/in/album-72157713097960397/" title="Xi’an"&gt;&lt;img alt="Xi’an" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49531765246_4a7d5e0d5c_z.jpg" style="width: 45%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biangbiang noodles, a famous regional dish of Shaanxi Province, has some notoriety among learners of Chinese characters due to its highly complex character with 58 strokes, that as of 2019 has not yet been encoded in Unicode. Although none of my Chinese friends actually like Biangbiang noodles, it’s something I’ve been wanting to try for a while, and thus entered one of plenty of local eateries that decorated their storefront with those characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/49531262603/" title="biang biang noodles"&gt;&lt;img alt="biang biang noodles" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49531262603_788ca80cbc_z.jpg" style="height:280px; width:500px;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The noodles itself were interesting; an appearance I hadn’t encountered before. A highly affordable and decent meal, although I’m not particularly fond of bok choy. More amusing was my communication with the waitress. Because I was by myself at the time and could not understand what she was saying, the waitress started typing something on what I assumed was an automatic translation app on her smartphone. What I was shown, however, was a text editor with the sentences she wrote down in Chinese characters as-is. Based on my limited study of the language and recognition of characters I recognized as a Japanese speaker, we were able to have a short conversation. Still not sure if she thought it normal for western foreigners to read Chinese, or if she just assumed I might have been a foreign student starting out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My flight back included a final day in Hong Kong. Since I was unable to meet my friend there after a failed first attempt, now would have been a good opportunity. Upon arrival in Hong Kong the afternoon a day ahead of departure, the ongoing Hong Kong protests reached new heights that left either of us unable to meet each other, with clusters of protesting right around the airport. Moreover, my credit card was for an unforeseen reason blocked and I could not withdraw cash from an ATM, leaving me once again stranded in in airport, forced to spend the night there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/49531990557/in/album-72157713097960397/" title="Boring boarding pass"&gt;&lt;img alt="Boring boarding pass" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49531990557_e71749d844_z.jpg" style="height:500px;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least my flight wasn’t canceled this time, though. ¯\(ツ)_/¯ (Oh, and while it’s bit of a cheap shot to laugh at such honest mistakes, the boring / boarding typo on the automatic check-in system was quite perfect. While my boarding pass might have been boring, the trip and everything it represented wasn’t, for sure.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="music"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#music"&gt;Music &lt;i class="icon-music small-font"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While traveling, I make a habit out of listening to local radio stations or asking recommendations to people I meet in hostels or bars, as my own form of personal souvenir. This time I have grown particularly fond of folk musician Hongyu Chen (陈鸿宇) and the singer-songwriter Hua Chenyu, whose experimental composition Cancer gives me goosebumps regardless how many times I listen to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id="conclusion"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#conclusion"&gt;Conclusion &lt;i class="icon-smile small-font"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not so much a real tourist trip through China as a short and wholesome visit to some people dear to me, I nevertheless thoroughly enjoyed my stay and was glad to experience firsthand some elements of daily life in a nation that is due to various socio-political an economical reasons still highly prone to a wide variety of negative stereotypes and misconceptions abroad. Thanks to my limited knowledge of the Chinese language, as well as the assistance of my Chinese friends, I was generally able to get by quite well as well. Due to a rise in local tourism, accessibility has reportedly increased immensely, but I must admit that for foreign travelers, especially those traveling alone and lacking Chinese language skills, going “off the beaten path” will be quite a challenge and require sufficient planning ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously there are highly contentious political elements that could and should be discussed concerning China. This blog post is however not the appropriate space for that; my trip there was intended primarily as a graduation trip in the company of some of my closest friends during my period as exchange student in Japan, and that I, dispute the hiccups, enjoyed immensely. I definitely look forward to return for a longer period of time, China is immense with a highly diverse ecosystem, natural beauty and rich history that I would love to further explore, perhaps next time while taking on the role of a more traditional tourist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, well, get utterly destroyed, that is. I’ve won the occasional round playing with my friends in Japan, but in hindsight I wonder if they let me win out of pity. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-1" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, the process of applying for a single entry 30-day tourist visa was surprisingly easy as well, given that you have a local friend able to vouch for you through an invitation letter (there are plenty of templates for that online). I did make the mistake of providing only the front-side of my friend’s passport, which could not be accepted. While trying to submit my application, I couldn’t reach my friend for a new scan, but fortunately another friend saved my skin by skipping class early and providing a complete invitation letter—we communicate in Japanese so that was a bit of a weird phone call in the Chinese embassy, though. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-2" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As one of the most important trade and financial hubs in Asia and one of the most densely populated regions in the world; Hong Kong (香港) has a distinct international feel. While historically undeniably Chinese, Hong Kong was conceded by the Qing Dinasty to British rule after the First Opium War and remained a British colony until 1997, with brief control under the Japanese Empire during the Second World War. The majority of Hong Kong’s population have Cantonese ancestry and Cantonese remains the region’s main language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Hong Kong, like Macau, has some political independence under Deng Xiaoping’s “one country, two systems” principle (一国两制), both Macau and Hong Kong are officially part of The People’s Republic of China under the statute of Special Administrative Region. This in turn does lead to occasional political tensions concerning the extent to which mainland China should be allowed governance over Hong Kong. Living in Japan with mutual friends from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, I’ve had the opportunity to get a more nuanced take on both sides, but I feel this particular blog is not the appropriate platform for such a topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="itinerary"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#itinerary"&gt;Itinerary &lt;i class="icon-plane small-font"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I spent the first half of my last-minute trip (around Taipei) mostly by myself, the second half of my trip (Hong Kong and Macao) was mostly spend with company and as a leisure trip to charge our batteries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took a Hong Kong Airline flight from Taipei to Hong Kong International Airport (a short flight but possibly the most comfortable I’ve flown so far) and arrived at my hotel early in the evening. Similar to the &lt;em&gt;EasyCard&lt;/em&gt; in Taiwan and &lt;em&gt;Pasmo&lt;/em&gt; in Japan, I bought a RFID metro card, the Octopus Card, in Hong Kong. Rather than a card, this one was designed a cute bear key-chain, again applicable as general payment method in most convenient stores and some restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="ginza-square"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#ginza-square"&gt;Ginza Square&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stayed at Harbour Plaza Resort City in &lt;strong&gt;Kingswood&lt;/strong&gt;, close to Ginza Square. While this place looks remarkably classy and far out of my league, it’s in what’s called the &lt;strong&gt;New Territories&lt;/strong&gt; (新界) in &lt;strong&gt;Tsin Shui Wai&lt;/strong&gt;. fairly far from central regions like Kowloon and thus quite affordable (also, a friend arranged a strong discount).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I arrived fairly late in the evening, most of the restaurants in the vicinity of the hotel were already closed. On advice of the hotel staff, we took a cab to a nearby region popular amongst locals for late night food and drinks. Rather than the likes of bars however, these were small pop-up joints set up in people’s garages. Luckily, my friend speaks Cantonese and ordered us some My Dim Sum and other dishes. The cook struck a conversation with my friend and it turns out she was quite curious what I felt of the food since I was the first visitor from the west. I quite enjoyed it and the general atmosphere, despite not speaking a word of Cantonese. One habit I was formerly unaware of though is washing one’s utensils with the hot tea provided with your meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/46909453515/" title="Ginza Square"&gt;&lt;img alt="Ginza Square" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/46909453515_0ecce75b73_z.jpg" style="height:480px; width:500px;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="central"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#central"&gt;Central&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Central&lt;/strong&gt; (中環) is most known as the financial district of Hong Kong, with massive skyscrapers of distinct architectural design. In contrast, heading a bit further in Central reveals small residential neighborhoods with artsy boutiques popping up around; as well as Hong Kong’s arguably most infamous outgoing scene: &lt;strong&gt;Lan Kwai Fong&lt;/strong&gt;, popularized in the west thanks to success of Hong Kong cinema, although I can’t say I particularly enjoyed the atmosphere there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong has a reputation as shopping paradise, due tax-free shopping and a haggling culture on the many street markets located both in the Kowloon strip and Hong Kong Island. We spent some time walking around &lt;strong&gt;Li Yuen Street Market&lt;/strong&gt; in Central, and the popular &lt;strong&gt;Ladies’ Market&lt;/strong&gt; in Kowloon. Even during week days, these places are fairly crowded and in combination with less-than-stellar air quality make these trips quite exhausting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/46909452195/" title="Market"&gt;&lt;img alt="Market" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/46909452195_c814f3bc0d_z.jpg" style="height:480px; width:500px;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="kowloon"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#kowloon"&gt;Kowloon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent most of our time around Tsim Sha Tsui, one of Hong Kong’s busiest neighborhoods, situated across Hong Kong Island’s many skyscrapers on Hong Kong’s Kowloon Peninsula.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/47036135014//" title="Victoria Harbour"&gt;&lt;img alt="Victoria Harbour" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/47036135014_fa959e6268_z.jpg" style="width:500px;height:281px"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hong Kong Cultural Center and surrounding Avenue of Stars on Tsim Sha Tsui’s waterfront offer a stunning view of Hong Kong island’s cityscape. Furthermore, the region has a daily light-show at 8PM, known as A Symphony of Lights; accompanied by an orchestral soundtrack, decorative lights and lasers on both sides lit up in bright neon colors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nearby Nathan Road and Shanghai Street are central shopping streets with a hectic mixture of high brand mega malls, restaurants and coffee shops, as well as smaller shops and boutiques overrun by tourists and locals alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the other unique locations was Chungking Mansions, an immense building formerly used Wong Kar-Wai’s Chungking Express, and known for being a mixture of incredibly cheap and small hostels, Indian, Nepalese and African eateries, electrical stores, foreign exchange offices, but also less legal practices. The brief time we spent walking around inside was unlike any other experience I’ve ever had. Countless times I was whispered into my ear offers for things ranging from cheap tailored suits to drugs and prostitution, but one time someone offered a compliment on my hairstyle, so that made up for things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless, as a cultural hotpot this place is a goldmine for anthropologists researching glottalization in Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/47036136334/in/album-72157708382487385/" title="Chung King"&gt;&lt;img alt="Chung King" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/47036136334_fb9db8ace4_z.jpg" style="width: 45%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="center border" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/47773565162/in/album-72157708382487385/" title="Hong Kong"&gt;&lt;img alt="Hong Kong" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/47773565162_5401013b2a_z.jpg" style="width: 45%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of interest was Yum Cha, a Dim Sum restaurant which, while notorious for its weak customer service, is incredibly popular amongst Japanese tourists for its Instagram-worthy sweet Dim Sums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/46909446635/in/album-72157708382487385/" title="Yum Cha"&gt;&lt;img alt="Yum Cha" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/46909446635_cb3d73ce20_z.jpg" style="height:500px"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="macau"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#macau"&gt;Macau&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my last day before returning to Japan we took a day trip to Macau (澳门), a Special Administrative Region of the PRC and until 1999 a former colony of Portugal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/47775008522/in/album-72157678196384197/" title="Macau"&gt;&lt;img alt="Macau" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/47775008522_3a0dccdf5c_z.jpg" style="width: 45%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="center border" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/40860682503/in/album-72157678196384197/" title="Casino"&gt;&lt;img alt="Casino" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/40860682503_8d6f3153ef_z.jpg" style="width: 45%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trip to Macau is quite cheap, and as an incredibly cheap flight destination it was financially more convenient to return to Japan through Macau’s airport. Although easily accessible by ferry, Macau is unrelated to Hong Kong and does requires a separate immigration process. Despite Macau’s rich history, the region is known primarily as Asia’s biggest gambling hub (generation more revenue as in Las Vegas) and attracts mostly tourists from mainland China interested in casino’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macau is divided into the island &lt;strong&gt;Taipa&lt;/strong&gt; (氹仔, where Macau’s airport and The Venetian, world’s largest casino, are located) and the &lt;strong&gt;Macau Peninsula&lt;/strong&gt; (澳門半島) connected to mainland China. The various casinos offer free shuttle buses covering both the island and peninsula, rendering public transport almost unnecessary. Casino’s offer free luggage service as well, regardless of reservations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/40860681393/in/album-72157678196384197/" title="Wynn Casino"&gt;&lt;img alt="Wynn Casino" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/40860681393_caffb58199_z.jpg" style="width: 45%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="center border" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/47775004272/in/album-72157678196384197/" title="Casino"&gt;&lt;img alt="Casino" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/47775004272_62cf376bb2_z.jpg" style="width: 45%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The juxtaposing of Portuguese and Chinese culture in Macau’s landscape, or at least what remains visible, is fascinating to say the least. My attention however was drawn more towards the contrast of massive themed casino’s (such as The Venetian) set against undeveloped ground, construction sites and almost slum-like residential regions undergoing gentrification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/46910915135/in/album-72157678196384197/" title="Macau"&gt;&lt;img alt="Macau" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/46910915135_8dda0af60f_z.jpg" style="width:500px;height:281px"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="music"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#music"&gt;Music &lt;i class="icon-music small-font"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While traveling, I make it a habit of finding good music by listening to local radio stations or asking recommendations to people I meet in hostels or bars, as my own form of personal souvenir. One of Hong Kong’s most popular musicians right now is Eason Chan, famous both in the Mandopop and Cantopop scene, but it’s honestly not that my thing. Instead I quite enjoy &lt;strong&gt;More Reverb&lt;/strong&gt;, a young Hong Kong instrumental post-rock band.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="videobox"&gt;
&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="390" mozallowfullscreen="" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zINu6ByHl5U" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="640"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="conclusion"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#conclusion"&gt;Conclusion &lt;i class="icon-smile small-font"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After having lived in Japan for almost 18 months, and coming straight from Taiwan, Hong Kong was quite a surprise, with strong contrasts both in terms of its international atmosphere and division of wealth. While I would’ve liked to have explored more, I was lucky to be accompanied with friends who showed me around and introduced me various locations and nice food. On a personal note, I had a period where I watched a lot of Hong Kong cinema, starting with Bruce Lee Kung Fu movies during when I practiced Kung Fu myself, to the Hong Kong New Wave and 90’s scene with famous directors and actors as Andrew Lau, johnnie To, Wong Kar-wai, Maggie Cheung, Tony Leung and Leslie Cheung. Visiting the location of those movies in real life was really cool!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As China’s only legal gambling hub, my trip to Macau offered a fascinating glimpse into the world of the rising Chinese nouveau riche class, which by far overshadows the colonial atmosphere the region has. Not being dirty rich myself however, I will probably limit my time in Macau to this one day-trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of my third semester in Japan, I took use of an extended school holiday &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; my last remaining months in Japan to plan a short trip to Taiwan and Hong Kong. During my stay I’ve had the pleasure to acquaint people from both regions and took this as the perfect excuse for some last minute sightseeing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id="brief-history"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#brief-history"&gt;Brief history &lt;i class="icon-history small-font"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Island of Taiwan (governed since 1945 by the Republic of China, 中華民國) is an East Asian state located southwest of the Japanese Okinawan islands. Dutch colonization and consequent annexation by the Qing dynasty in the 17&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, as well as annexation and five decades of rule by by the Empire of Japan after the Sino-Japanese war of 1894-1895, have had a drastic impact on Taiwan’s demography, and presently the Taiwanese indigenous people make up only 2% of the population. Taiwan’s political status and its relation to mainland China, as well as domestic opinions on Japan, remains controversial topics. Nevertheless, the ease of entry for foreign visitors, as well as Taiwan’s scenic beauty and vibrant cultural scene have made Taiwan a popular destination for both mainland Chinese and Japanese nationals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="itinerary"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#itinerary"&gt;Itinerary &lt;i class="icon-plane small-font"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due budget and time restraints I spent just two nights in Taiwan: centered around Taipei with one day trip to some of the more famous spots amongst Japanese tourists. I took an early flight from Tokyo’s &lt;strong&gt;Haneda Airport&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport&lt;/strong&gt; and arrived in Taipei Airport around noon. Preliminary preparations including currency exchange and the purchase of EasyCard RFID smart-card (with student discount) for the Taipei Metro transit system. Like Pasmo and Suica cards in Japan this card is widely accepted in convenience stores and retail outlets as well so I ended up using this as my primary means of payment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-1-taipei"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#day-1-taipei"&gt;Day 1: Taipei&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a brisk short train ride I arrived at Taipei Station and experienced Taipei’s outside air and surroundings for the first time. It was by all means a beautiful, sunny day, but due the time of the year quite humid as well and I realized I’m not particularly good at dealing with tropical temperatures. Luckily my hostel, located near the National Taiwan Museum and Peace Park, was but a short walk from the station. On my way, I was struck by the amount of palm trees and the widespread use of motorcycles. I thought …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">

&lt;p&gt;At the end of my third semester in Japan, I took use of an extended school holiday &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; my last remaining months in Japan to plan a short trip to Taiwan and Hong Kong. During my stay I’ve had the pleasure to acquaint people from both regions and took this as the perfect excuse for some last minute sightseeing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id="brief-history"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#brief-history"&gt;Brief history &lt;i class="icon-history small-font"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Island of Taiwan (governed since 1945 by the Republic of China, 中華民國) is an East Asian state located southwest of the Japanese Okinawan islands. Dutch colonization and consequent annexation by the Qing dynasty in the 17&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, as well as annexation and five decades of rule by by the Empire of Japan after the Sino-Japanese war of 1894-1895, have had a drastic impact on Taiwan’s demography, and presently the Taiwanese indigenous people make up only 2% of the population. Taiwan’s political status and its relation to mainland China, as well as domestic opinions on Japan, remains controversial topics. Nevertheless, the ease of entry for foreign visitors, as well as Taiwan’s scenic beauty and vibrant cultural scene have made Taiwan a popular destination for both mainland Chinese and Japanese nationals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a brisk short train ride I arrived at Taipei Station and experienced Taipei’s outside air and surroundings for the first time. It was by all means a beautiful, sunny day, but due the time of the year quite humid as well and I realized I’m not particularly good at dealing with tropical temperatures. Luckily my hostel, located near the National Taiwan Museum and Peace Park, was but a short walk from the station. On my way, I was struck by the amount of palm trees and the widespread use of motorcycles. I thought there was some motorcycle event going on but this turned out to be just a daily thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/40853549033/" title="Taipei Peace Park"&gt;&lt;img alt="Taipei Peace Park" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/40853549033_584a87b8fd_z.jpg" style="height:480px; width:500px;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After checking in and refreshing myself, I went out to explore my surroundings, spending a fair amount of time at the beautiful &lt;strong&gt;228 Peace Park&lt;/strong&gt;. Some elderly people were practicing &lt;em&gt;taichi&lt;/em&gt; and one man appeared to be practicing operatic singing; a bit of an unusual activity in public spaces, but not particularly displeasing. From there I took a subway to Taipei’s most well-known temple, the 300 year old folk religious &lt;strong&gt;Longshan Temple&lt;/strong&gt; (龍山寺). The history of the temple, its syncretistic background (the temple originated as a Buddhist place of worship but incorporates elements of Taoism and folk religions as well) and architectural design were fascinating to observe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My next planned destination was the so-called &lt;strong&gt;Elephant Mountain&lt;/strong&gt; (象山); a steep hill and popular hiking trail near the massive &lt;strong&gt;Taipei 101 tower&lt;/strong&gt;. Despite the heat the trail was quite busy; drawing in tourists and locals alike to view the phenomenal sunset over the city. One man, shirtless, took the opportunity to show us his physical prowess by repeatedly jogging up-and-down and performing push-ups every few steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The view from the top was phenomenal. Several large, climbable stones give the opportunity for tourists to take Instagramable photographs, creating the illusion of peaceful solitude. Said spot was however quite crowded and due the academic holidays in Japan, filled with young Japanese people visiting Taiwan as a graduate trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/47820062191/" title="Elephant Mountain"&gt;&lt;img alt="Elephant Mountain" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/47820062191_fe1708207b_z.jpg" style="height:480px; width:500px;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a beautiful sunset, I descended the mountain and headed towards Taipei 101, formerly the world’s tallest skyscraper and known for its distinct postmodernist architectural style. While a bit steep, I did enter the building and rode the elevator to the top floors. The skyscraper has a visible ‘tuned mass damper’, a massive steel pendulum designed to protect and offset movement from strong winds or earthquakes. Though clearly touristic in nature, the surroundings of the building were quite lovely as well; with a variety of artwork and a cute structure based on Chinese children’s book &lt;em&gt;When the Moon Forgot&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/47820061431/in/album-72157680339192988/" title="Taipei 101"&gt;&lt;img alt="Taipei 101" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/47820061431_33976c07a5_z.jpg" style="height: 45%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I spent the evening by strolling through a nearby night market, the &lt;strong&gt;Linjiang Night Market&lt;/strong&gt; (臨江夜市, also known as &lt;strong&gt;Tonghua Night Market&lt;/strong&gt; 通化夜市 due its proximity to &lt;strong&gt;Linjiang Street&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Tonghua Street&lt;/strong&gt;). Aside from the compulsory Taiwanese bubble tea, I enjoyed popular street food such as &lt;em&gt;stinky tofu&lt;/em&gt;, steam fried buns and egg tarts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/47820060641/in/album-72157680339192988/" title="Stinky Tofu"&gt;&lt;img alt="Stinky Tofu" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/47820060641_73a4519115_z.jpg" style="width: 45%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;h2 id="day-2-day-trip-pingxi-line"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#day-2-day-trip-pingxi-line"&gt;Day 2: Day-trip - Pingxi Line (平溪線)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My day-trip today was centered around probably the most popular tourist destinations near Taipei, often combined in one day trip: the towns of &lt;strong&gt;Shifen&lt;/strong&gt; (十分), which is known for its railway market street, floating lanterns and lush waterfall) along with &lt;strong&gt;Jiufen&lt;/strong&gt; (九份, often associated with Ghibli’s award-winning animation Spirited Away). Getting to both places was enough but required a short trip from Taipei Station to a small nearby village called &lt;strong&gt;Ruifang&lt;/strong&gt; (瑞芳), from where one can access the Pingxi Line: a short railway line connecting former mining villages around the &lt;strong&gt;Pingxi Valley&lt;/strong&gt; (平溪). I personally recommend purchasing a cheap Pingxi Line day pass as many of the destinations on the line are worth visiting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="shifen"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#shifen"&gt;Shifen (十分)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my way to Shifen I befriended an elderly Japanese couple who happen to live quite close to my apartment in Tokyo. One of the two actually graduated from Chuo University, a pleasant coincidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After exiting the station, I landed straight on Shifen’s main street, the &lt;strong&gt;Shifen Old Street&lt;/strong&gt; (十分老街). A popular scenic spot, the Pingxi Line runs straight through this pad. When the train passed, paying visitors write their wishes on large &lt;em&gt;sky lanterns&lt;/em&gt; and set them off in the sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/47767779072/in/album-72157680339192988/" title="Shifen"&gt;&lt;img alt="Shifen" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/47767779072_3a7a804879_z.jpg" style="height:500px;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;North of the Old Street, a scenic path leads to the famous 30-meter-wide Shifen Waterfall (十分大瀑布); a bit hard to portray through just pictures, but this alone was worth the Pingxi Line trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="houtong-cat-village"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#houtong-cat-village"&gt;Houtong Cat Village (猴硐貓村)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like other villages on the Pingxi line, the village of Houtong was traditionally a mining village, and due the well-kept state of its mining infrastructure; offers curious visitors a brief glimpse in its mining history. The primary reason for its touristic growth however is due its immense cat population; claimed to be twice that of its local (human) population. Some boutiques offered quite cute cat-themed hand-made trinkets or desserts, and I couldn’t help myself to this amazingly cute cat cake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/32876151867/in/album-72157680339192988/" title="Houtong Cat Village cat cake"&gt;&lt;img alt="Houtong Cat Village cat cake" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/32876151867_fefe873f0c_z.jpg" style="width: 45%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="center border" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/32876151847/in/album-72157680339192988/" title="Houtong Cat Village"&gt;&lt;img alt="Houtong Cat Village" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/32876151847_06b05866cc_z.jpg" style="width: 45%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="jiufen"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#jiufen"&gt;Jiufen (九份)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After my trip through the Pingxi area, I returned to Ruifang and scheduled my next trip, the former gold mining mountain village of Jiufen. On my way to the bus stop, I hoped to purchase a snack at a local food stall. While queuing in line I was however denied by the proprietor who claimed their food to be sold out (没有！没有！). My limited knowledge of the Mandarin language was however sufficient to defend my honor while walking away (真的沒有嗎？好的，我明白了。). Nevertheless it was a bit frustrating to see those behind me in the queue being served after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/32876151987/in/album-72157680339192988/" title="Jiufen"&gt;&lt;img alt="Jiufen" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/32876151987_d85c55d283_z.jpg" style="width: 45%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="center border" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/40853527613/in/album-72157680339192988/" title="Jiufen"&gt;&lt;img alt="Jiufen" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/40853527613_d1b48bdeb2_z.jpg" style="width: 45%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visually, Jiufen reflects the rapid development it underwent as a gold mining town under Japanese occupation, with many wooden structures having a unique colonial-era Japanese feeling. &lt;strong&gt;A-mei Tea House&lt;/strong&gt; (阿妹茶楼) in particular, due its resemblance to Japanese animation Spirited Away’s bathhouse, draws huge amounts of Japanese crowds. Facing Taiwan’s northeast coast, Jiufen scenery at night is breathtaking. The wooden structures in &lt;strong&gt;Jiufen old street&lt;/strong&gt; (九份老街) undergo a drastic transformation once the many red lanterns are lit at night; and while crowded even during average weekdays, remains magical to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drained of energy, I lined up at the A-mei Tea House for a break; and while queuing incidentally met the Japanese couple next to me on the airplane. Turns out they live near Ikebukuro, a region of Tokyo I visit on a near-daily base. Not surprisingly, their two-night visit to Taiwan was planned as a graduation trip, with Jiufen as personal highlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/47767788782/" title="A-MEI Tea House in Jiufen"&gt;&lt;img alt="A-MEI Tea House in Jiufen" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/47767788782_332b4dc31e_z.jpg" style="width:500px;height:281px"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Jiufen, I took a late night shuttle bus back to Taipei. Two Japanese girls next to me struck up a conversation with me; and again it turned out they live relatively to my region. Starting to feel like a conspiracy theory, but statistically not unrealistic considering I was living in one of the most populous regions of the world. One of the two told a cute story of how she met her boyfriend on a Japanese learning application and planned a working holiday in India to be with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unrelated but the brown sugar boba milk tea I order at the Jiufen storefront of popular Taiwanese Bubble Milk Tea brand &lt;strong&gt;Xing Fu Tang&lt;/strong&gt; (幸福堂), was by far the best I’ve had this trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/47820041351/in/album-72157680339192988/" title="Xing Fu Tang bubbletea"&gt;&lt;img alt="Xing Fu Tang bubbletea" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/47820041351_26c96e77ff_z.jpg" style="height:500px;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-3-taipei"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#day-3-taipei"&gt;Day 3: Taipei&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I’d have loved to spent more time around Taipei or in Taiwan in general, I had a flight to Hong Kong planned at night and the scorching heat this day prevented me from strenuous trips. I passed by the &lt;strong&gt;Chiang Kai Shek Memorial Hall&lt;/strong&gt; (中正紀念堂) before spending my last hours in &lt;strong&gt;Ningxia Night Market&lt;/strong&gt; (寧夏夜市) stocking up on the compulsory gifts for back home, and ordering one last tapioca milk tea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/40853527033/" title="Chiang Kai Shek Memorial Hall"&gt;&lt;img alt="Chiang Kai Shek Memorial Hall" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/40853527033_e3f4550d30_z.jpg" style="width:500px;height:281px"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="music"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#music"&gt;Music &lt;i class="icon-music small-font"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While traveling, I’ve made it habit of listening to local radio stations or ask for recommendations on any local music scene, as a form of personal souvenir. I’ve become quite fond of the Taiwanese-born &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-Mei"&gt;A-Mei&lt;/a&gt;, one of the most successful Manderin-singing pop musicians alive. The following track is of the 2015 album AMIT2, an album I’ve listened to many times since my return to Belgium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="conclusion"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#conclusion"&gt;Conclusion &lt;i class="icon-smile small-font"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to make general conclusions on just several days of sightseeing, but at the very least I was taken a bit aback by the amount of Japanese tourists in Taipei. While I expected Jiufen and the A-mei teahouse to be popular due its association with the bathhouse in Spirited Away, it wouldn’t be that much of an exaggeration to claim the language I heard the most was Japanese rather than Mandarin. At some times while eating out or browsing in shops, it was actually easier for me as a foreign tourist to communicate in Japanese rather than in English; something I felt a bit mixed about. Talks with Taiwanese friends revealed a strong positive attitude towards Japan. Younger people care little for its colonial history and are drawn to Japan’s soft-power as cultural powerhouse; which was undeniably visibly present anywhere I went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That aside, I had a lovely stay and immensely enjoyed the scenery, cuisine and vibrant atmosphere Taipei and its surroundings offered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the start of the new academic year in Japan, early April, I joined a music circle and formed several bands with other members of the circle. During the summer break, one of my band’s members invited me to join his class’ study trip to Fukushima; gaining first hand experience at methods Fukushima’s civilians are employing to revitalize Fukushima’s tourist industry after the 2011 earthquake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id="brief-history"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#brief-history"&gt;Brief history &lt;i class="icon-history small-font"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third largest prefecture in Japan, Fukushima is a northeastern region popular amongst Japanese not just as winter resort, but for its Japanese sake, food and many natural hot springs. Historically, Fukushima is known for it’s role in the last feudal Samurai war, the 1868 Bosshin War. Today however, the region remains heavily associated with the 2011 earthquake and subsequent nuclear disaster. An earthquake on 11 March 2011 led to a tsunami disabling most of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (located on the Pacific Ocean coastline of central Fukushima) and subsequent nuclear meltdowns due insufficient cooling. Despite strong criticism on government-level handling of the situation, much has been done on a local scale to restore Fukushima to its former level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="itinerary"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#itinerary"&gt;Itinerary &lt;i class="icon-plane small-font"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A system quite common to Japan and less so where I’m from is the zemi system (derived from the seminar system in Germany); classes of around 10 students working together with the professor in interactive ways about a specific topic the professor is interested in. Usually groups become quite tight and occasionally join the professor for some food and drinks at night, as well as go on study trips (read: glorified city-trips). Earlier this year I had the opportunity of joining my German professor and three other students from KU Leuven studying in Japan for such a study-trip in Matsumoto, but this was my first opportunity doing in a full Japanese context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I was not part of the class, my friend and band-mate mentioned that that shouldn’t deter me from joining; in fact due the topic in question, input from a non-Japanese student would actually be highly appreciated, or so he assured me. Taught by Dr. Prof. Hosono (細野教授), the class itself (FLP, or Faculty-Linkage Program) is open for students of different academic backgrounds and often focuses on international issues.

&lt;p&gt;The students worked around the concept of …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">

&lt;p&gt;At the start of the new academic year in Japan, early April, I joined a music circle and formed several bands with other members of the circle. During the summer break, one of my band’s members invited me to join his class’ study trip to Fukushima; gaining first hand experience at methods Fukushima’s civilians are employing to revitalize Fukushima’s tourist industry after the 2011 earthquake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id="brief-history"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#brief-history"&gt;Brief history &lt;i class="icon-history small-font"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third largest prefecture in Japan, Fukushima is a northeastern region popular amongst Japanese not just as winter resort, but for its Japanese sake, food and many natural hot springs. Historically, Fukushima is known for it’s role in the last feudal Samurai war, the 1868 Bosshin War. Today however, the region remains heavily associated with the 2011 earthquake and subsequent nuclear disaster. An earthquake on 11 March 2011 led to a tsunami disabling most of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (located on the Pacific Ocean coastline of central Fukushima) and subsequent nuclear meltdowns due insufficient cooling. Despite strong criticism on government-level handling of the situation, much has been done on a local scale to restore Fukushima to its former level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="itinerary"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#itinerary"&gt;Itinerary &lt;i class="icon-plane small-font"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A system quite common to Japan and less so where I’m from is the zemi system (derived from the seminar system in Germany); classes of around 10 students working together with the professor in interactive ways about a specific topic the professor is interested in. Usually groups become quite tight and occasionally join the professor for some food and drinks at night, as well as go on study trips (read: glorified city-trips). Earlier this year I had the opportunity of joining my German professor and three other students from KU Leuven studying in Japan for such a study-trip in Matsumoto, but this was my first opportunity doing in a full Japanese context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I was not part of the class, my friend and band-mate mentioned that that shouldn’t deter me from joining; in fact due the topic in question, input from a non-Japanese student would actually be highly appreciated, or so he assured me. Taught by Dr. Prof. Hosono (細野教授), the class itself (FLP, or Faculty-Linkage Program) is open for students of different academic backgrounds and often focuses on international issues. This semester, students worked on city-planning in disaster-struck areas (まちづくり) with a case-study of tourism in Fukushima.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center noshadow"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/32899526487/in/album-72157708568624144/" title="School"&gt;&lt;img alt="School" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/32899526487_bd1541218d_z.jpg" style="height:480px; width:500px;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The students worked around the concept of a &lt;a href="https://www.hopetourism.jp/"&gt;Fukushima Hope tour&lt;/a&gt; (福島県HOPETOUR). How can Fukushima citizens work bottom-up towards reigniting Fukushima tourism? How should they utilize technology such as social media and translation tools to draw in foreign tourists; how can they shift the focus point from so-called disaster (dark) tourism? Are there any routes throughout Fukushima offering starting points to Fukushima’s history, cuisine and natural beauty? What strategies are appropriate to attract previous tourists in different seasons?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three-day itinerary planned around Fukushima would first visit the formerly abandoned villages of &lt;strong&gt;Namie&lt;/strong&gt; (浪江) and &lt;strong&gt;Tomioka&lt;/strong&gt; (富岡町), passing closely to the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant itself. During this time, students have the opportunity to talk to some of the locals who’ve decided to return there and reopen businesses. Afterwards, the bus will head for a japanese-style inn (旅館) at Iizaka Hot Springs, near the centrum of Fukushima, were we will spend the night. The next two days were spent in the Aizu (会津) area, specifically &lt;strong&gt;Aizu-Wakamatsu&lt;/strong&gt; (会津若松), &lt;strong&gt;Kitakata&lt;/strong&gt; (喜多) and &lt;strong&gt;Ouchijuku&lt;/strong&gt;, focusing more on the historical aspects of Fukushima as well as natural beauty and cuisine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HOWEVER! I just purchased a new smart-phone several days earlier and I found out the hard way my alarm app did not function properly. I woke up two hours too late and missed my train to Tomioka. I was forced to buy a new bullet train ticket and catch up with the group in Iizaka, missing the first part of the itinerary. (ू˃︿˂ ू)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fukushima-city"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#fukushima-city"&gt;Fukushima City&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a brief mental breakdown over oversleeping and missing my train, I ended up going directly to Fukushima City by bullet train and spent a few hours walking around the city, having a brief conversation with an old baker who’d never talked to a foreigner before and was interested in my opinion on the texture of his melon pan (decent). After a further uneventful trip I headed towards Iizaka through the cute Iizaka Line (飯坂線) and met up with the FLP class who’d arrived around the same. Not the best first impression but it didn’t really bother anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="iizaka-onsen"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#iizaka-onsen"&gt;iizaka onsen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iizaka Onsen&lt;/strong&gt; (飯坂温泉) is a quaint hot springs resort in the central area of the Fukushima prefecture (Nakadori, 中通り). Coming straight from Tokyo, the town does have a bit of a rustic look, somewhat shabby even at times, but that’s part of the charm for sure. The town is historically based around its natural hot springs and there are many public baths, traditional Japanese inns, as well as free foot-baths around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although we ended up using the hot springs at our inn, we passed the oldest public baths in Japan, Sabakoyu (鯖湖湯), famous for having been visited by famous poet Matsuo Basho and reaching temperatures up to 50°C. These public baths form a social function and even now the free foot-baths around are used by weary passengers taking a break and having a chat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center noshadow"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/32899526077/in/album-72157708568624144/" title="iizaka onsen"&gt;&lt;img alt="iizaka onsen" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/32899526077_ab50b3d49e_z.jpg" style="height: 45%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="center noshadow" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/32899526107/in/album-72157708568624144/" title="iizaka onsen"&gt;&lt;img alt="iizaka onsen" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/32899526107_5a1454cb12_z.jpg" style="height: 45%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inn we stayed at, &lt;a href="http://horieya.com/"&gt;Horieya inn&lt;/a&gt; (ほりえや旅館), was established in the 1815 and is still run by the same family. While a bit modernized to accommodate modern necessities, The wooden architecture and base of the building has remained completely intact. Before dinner, one of the proprietors briefed us on Horieya Inn, Iizaka Onsen, and the methods Iizaka locals are employing to revitalize tourism in the area. Everything is done on a community-scale, including digital techniques such as home-pages and social networks as Twitter. Even the website (linked above) is made in-house, and while very much bare-bones, displays the tenacity and perseverance of a mostly aging community to utilize new technology, as well as a &lt;a href="http://horieya.com/iizaka.html"&gt;lovely sense of humor&lt;/a&gt;. Do note the English, Chinese and Korean accommodation of the website using Google Translate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On that topic, it is worth checking out the official &lt;a href="http://iizaka.info/sightseeing-spots/"&gt;Iizaka Onsen’s&lt;/a&gt; website as well. Despite similar design choices, the tourist association has taken much care in providing handmade translations in English, both traditional and simplified Chinese, Korean, Thai and Russian, as well as providing maps throughout the town highlighting natural beauty and cuisine throughout the four seasons. Bicycles and umbrella’s are available for free at the station, by the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center noshadow"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/32899526757/in/album-72157708568624144/" title="Iizaka"&gt;&lt;img alt="Iizaka" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/32899526757_6e76dbff11_z.jpg" style="height:500px;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our meal, made with fresh community-driven Iizaka ingredients was delightful, as was the Onsen and our room (I stayed in a room with another graduate student and my band-mate, nicknamed 赤パンツ or ‘red pants’ for his daily choice of trousers, by the way). At night, we joined several other students for some drinks and a few rounds of party-game &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game)"&gt;Werewolf&lt;/a&gt; (jinro, 人狼 in Japanese). Tips for future players, abusing your status as Japanese-learning foreigner is an easy way to feint innocence. One of the fourth year students, responsible for some of the trip’s organization and financial aspects, found out about gathering and got rather angry that we weren’t sleeping yet, going so far as to insinuate we were irresponsible. A bit of a mood-killer, we returned to our rooms and slept briefly but well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="aizu-wakamatsu"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#aizu-wakamatsu"&gt;Aizu-Wakamatsu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our next day was spent around the castle town of &lt;strong&gt;Aizu-Wakamatsu&lt;/strong&gt; (会津若松), as well as the nearby &lt;strong&gt;Ouchijuku&lt;/strong&gt; (大内宿) and &lt;strong&gt;Iimoriyama&lt;/strong&gt; (飯盛山). Historically, Aizu-Wakamatsu is known as a castle town of the Aizu Domain and the main setting of the Boshin War, a civil war between those in support of maintaining the shogunate system (the feudal Japanese military government), and those trying to overthrow the shogunate after discontent regarding Japan’s opening to the west.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While 2018 marks 150 years since the Meiji Revolution, the Aizu region aims to focus rather on 150 years since the Bosshin War, hoping to attract tourists for its samurai history. We headed to &lt;strong&gt;Aizu Bukeyashiki&lt;/strong&gt; (会津武家屋敷), known as a residence or mansion for high ranking Aizu samurai. The building is quite extensive and attempts to sketch daily life of Aizu samurai in the middle ages. During our talk with one of the proprietors, we learned of the Aizu-Wakamatsu community to in similar fashion utilize technology to attract and re-attract both national and international tourists; teaching staff how to use voice-translation software and implementing credit-card payment systems around town. The following Youtube video attempts to portray the natural beauty of Bukeyashiki during all four seasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="videobox"&gt;
&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="390" mozallowfullscreen="" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ivmmoXix_-c" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="640"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stayed in a hostel near &lt;strong&gt;Nanokamachi Street&lt;/strong&gt; (七日町通り), close to the famous &lt;strong&gt;Tsuruga Castle&lt;/strong&gt;. While the current one is a concrete replica, the original castle ( was demolished after the Boshin war) served as administrative center of Aizu and has ties to the famous Date Masamune. The inside of the building has been rebuilt as museum with some interactive elements and various video-material displaying the history of the castle and Aizu samurai. The view from the top is worth the entrance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center noshadow"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/47053918844/in/album-72157708568624144/" title="Tsuruga Castle"&gt;&lt;img alt="Tsuruga Castle" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/47053918844_32d7eebf2e_z.jpg" style="width:500px;height:281px"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="iimoriyama"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#iimoriyama"&gt;Iimoriyama&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iimoriyama&lt;/strong&gt; (Mount Iimori, 飯盛山) is a hill most famous for a famous media event related to the Bosshin War. The story tells the tragic suicide of a group of 19 teenagers (belonging to the &lt;strong&gt;Byakkotai&lt;/strong&gt; 白虎隊 or White Tiger Company military unit) who had retreated here to assess the situation, and (wrongfully) believing the castle had fallen, committed ritual suicide as final means to defend their honor. This story is one of many tragic so-called &lt;em&gt;bushido&lt;/em&gt;-related stories immortalized as war-time propaganda, and actually impressed Italian fascist leader Mussolini to the extent he donated a Pompeii archaeological column to the site. A 1930’s donation from German side can be found here as well, in the form of a black granite plate with an Iron Cross inscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center noshadow"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/32899537487/in/album-72157708568624144/" title="Iimoriyama"&gt;&lt;img alt="Iimoriyama" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/32899537487_7416c60df1_z.jpg" style="height: 45%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="center noshadow" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/32899549397/in/album-72157708568624144/" title="Iimoriyama"&gt;&lt;img alt="Iimoriyama" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/32899549397_aaca09b857_z.jpg" style="height: 45%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another interesting construction is the &lt;strong&gt;Aizu Sazaedo&lt;/strong&gt; (会津さざえ堂), a completely wooden hexagonal Buddhist pagoda built in 1796, known for its ‘double-helix’ structure. The building is devoted to Kannon, and worshipers descent the building through a different way as the ascent to avoid disturbing each other. Aside from the striking wooden construction, visitors will immediately notice an enormous amount of labels with calligraphy attached pretty much everywhere. This was done by Edo period ‘tourists’ as proof of one’s visit. Some things never change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center noshadow"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/32899548147/in/album-72157708568624144/" title="Iimoriyama"&gt;&lt;img alt="Iimoriyama" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/32899548147_2b3dfe75f3_z.jpg" style="width:500px;height:281px"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, the lush nature juxtaposed with the plentiful faded gravestones, the wooden Aizu Sazaedo and the oddly befitting Pompeii eagle make Iimori an absolutely beautiful, must-visit area when in Fukushima.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center noshadow"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/32899525647/in/album-72157708568624144/" title="Aizu-Wakamatsu"&gt;&lt;img alt="Aizu-Wakamatsu" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/32899525647_200b92eaf4_z.jpg" style="width: 45%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="center noshadow" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/32899525757/in/album-72157708568624144/" title="Ouchijuku"&gt;&lt;img alt="Ouchijuku" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/32899525757_10dd305d72_z.jpg" style="width: 45%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ouchijuku"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#ouchijuku"&gt;Ouchijuku&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="center noshadow"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/32899536897/in/album-72157708568624144/" title="Ouchijuku"&gt;&lt;img alt="Ouchijuku" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/32899536897_c9cfaa3171_z.jpg" style="width: 45%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="center noshadow" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/40876729993/in/album-72157708568624144/" title="Ouchijuku"&gt;&lt;img alt="Ouchijuku" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/40876729993_bd1ee621eb_z.jpg" style="width: 45%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our next visit was the former post town of Ouchijuku (大内宿), which connected Aizu with Nikko during a period in which restrictions by the shogunate let by frequent obligatory travels to the capital of Edo (modern-day Tokyo). The area has been redeveloped as popular tourist destination for those looking for an authentic view of Japan’s feudal history. The region thrives on tourism, with many shops selling handmade trinkets or grilled fish. One of the proprietors of a tatami-floored restaurant we had dinner took some time to explain some processes of their local cuisine (&lt;strong&gt;negi soba&lt;/strong&gt;, scallion buckwheat noodles)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center noshadow"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/32899526857/in/album-72157708568624144/" title="Ouchijuku"&gt;&lt;img alt="Ouchijuku" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/32899526857_ec352bf489_z.jpg" style="height:500px;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The well preserved buildings, with thatched roofs made from dried straw, dirt tracks, and untouched natural beauty (electricity cables are buried underground) have made this place a highlight of my stay in Japan. We spent the remainder of our day around this area before taking our bus back to our hostel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center noshadow"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/46927239415/in/album-72157708568624144/" title="Ouchijuku"&gt;&lt;img alt="Ouchijuku" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/46927239415_6e0744c809_z.jpg" style="height:500px;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before dinner, professor Hosono held an impromptu class on the topic of city planning, and asked the students to present their findings. As a foreign student, I was asked of my experience as well and had to present some ideas on revitalizing tourism in Fukushima, drawing attention away from the 2011 earthquake and disaster tourism. After dinner, I joined most of the students for a final drink (お疲れ会) and some games before calling it a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="kitakata"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#kitakata"&gt;Kitakata&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning, we visited &lt;strong&gt;Kitakata&lt;/strong&gt; (喜多), a city in Aizu today known particularly for its many ramen restaurants (over 130 stores!), sake and historic warehouses (&lt;em&gt;kura&lt;/em&gt;, 蔵) used for storing dried foodstuffs. It’s commonly said that the high quality water in the neighborhood lead to its famous production of sake and noodles, but before we could try this ourselves we were led to a completely different shop: the &lt;strong&gt;Okuya Peanut Factory Shop&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center noshadow"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/32899554207/in/album-72157708568624144/" title="Okuya Peanut Factory Shop"&gt;&lt;img alt="Okuya Peanut Factory Shop" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/32899554207_b283f16eaf_z.jpg" style="width: 45%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="center noshadow" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/46927274045/in/album-72157708568624144/" title="Okuya Peanut Factory Shop"&gt;&lt;img alt="Okuya Peanut Factory Shop" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/46927274045_a0c43364b9_z.jpg" style="width: 45%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, Kitakata is rich in peanuts. We had an interview with the proprietor and received a tour around the stock-house, detailing both the business’ history as well as the technical aspects of processing peanuts. The things I’m learning on exchange in Japan. Okuya Peanut Factory Shop has grown to the point this originally one-man-business is now a strong exporter of both refined and unrefined peanuts and became a local hot-spot for peanut soft-serve ice cream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peanut Ice
Due the clear, high quality waters nearby, the town of kitakata has plenty of premium sake breweries as well. We visited the &lt;strong&gt;Yamatogawa Sake Brewery&lt;/strong&gt;, dating back to 1790 and using only in-house cultivated Kitakata water and rice. We had the opportunity to visit their storehouse and engage in some tasting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center noshadow"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/32899526187/in/album-72157708568624144/" title="Kitakata Sake"&gt;&lt;img alt="Kitakata Sake" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/32899526187_1f897ba6c8_z.jpg" style="width: 65%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="center noshadow" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/47053919584/in/album-72157708568624144/" title="Peanut Ice"&gt;&lt;img alt="Peanut Ice" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/47053919584_374fcc0a86_z.jpg" style="width: 25%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After our sake tasting, we had just an hour for lunch before ending our study-trip, and hurried to arguably the most famous ramen restaurant in Kitakata: &lt;strong&gt;Abe Shokudo&lt;/strong&gt; (あべ食堂). On our way, we actually passed a small shrine dedicated to ramen. No time for distractions though; there was some serious eating to be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center noshadow"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/33966094608/in/album-72157708568624144/" title="Kitakata Ramen"&gt;&lt;img alt="Kitakata Ramen" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/33966094608_54d8ea6892_z.jpg" style="width: 45%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="center noshadow" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/32899552627/in/album-72157708568624144/" title="Kitakata Ramen"&gt;&lt;img alt="Kitakata Ramen" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/32899552627_fd6f4f261d_z.jpg" style="width: 45%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s right. Two pictures. My band-mate is a known ramen-aficionado and we ended up using our limited time during lunch to visit a second ramen restaurant right after, &lt;strong&gt;Makoto Shokudo&lt;/strong&gt; (まこと食堂). Although we were several minutes late to our bus back to the station and thus again got scolded by the fourth year student in charge of organization, I can’t say I regret making the decision to have a second portion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="conclusion"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#conclusion"&gt;Conclusion &lt;i class="icon-smile small-font"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m still a bitter I missed the first part of the trip, but nevertheless it was a wonderful experience joining my friend on a school-trip and something I hadn’t expected to happen while studying in Japan. A good combination of studying, tourism and playtime amongst other students, I didn’t get too much sleep this trip but instead I got first-hand experience in Japanese student-life and good memories. Many talks with local citizens collaborating in revitalizing Fukushima’s tourism helped me get a deeper insight into aspects of marketing as well as the great extents of community-driven development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center noshadow"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/32899527017/in/album-72157708568624144/" title="FLP"&gt;&lt;img alt="FLP" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/32899527017_0fbe1b1503_z.jpg" style="width:500px;height:350px"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prefecture of Fukushima is in the public mind still, and especially amongst foreign tourists, deeply connected to the 2011 earthquake and nuclear disaster; needless to say dramatically affecting Fukushima tourism. Regardless of my opinion on nuclear energy and the handling of the actual incident, international research does show radiation levels on average in Fukushima, especially in distant areas like Aizu, to be equal or even lower than the average of unaffected major cities around the world. While tourists are primarily drawn to regions as Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto and Nara; there is much to be discovered in Fukushima, a region of exceptional natural beauty, local cuisine, hot spring baths and well-maintained historical elements in daily life scenery. I thus sincerely do recommend future travelers to travel outside of this fixed ‘Japan-itinerary’ and enjoy the lifelong efforts of local communities such as those of Fukushima to promote their homes to travelers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last April, I had the pleasure to my professor from KU Leuven on a study-trip to Matsumoto, accompanied by several KU Leuven schoolmates also present in Japan, as well as a Japanese historian and professor at Matsumoto’s Shinshū University, and his seminar students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On our study-trip, we would first visit the &lt;strong&gt;Old System Matsumoto High School Museum&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Kyūsei Matsumoto kōkō kinenkan&lt;/em&gt; 旧制松本高校記念館) and received a guided tour to a tunnel in &lt;strong&gt;Satoyama&lt;/strong&gt;, said to be dug out by forced laborers during the last few months of the Pacific War. Later on we would visit &lt;strong&gt;Shinshū University&lt;/strong&gt; and hold an impromptu seminar on the topics covered that day, before the obligatory &lt;em&gt;nomikai&lt;/em&gt; (飲み会). On our second day, we would join our professor in the morning for brief breakfast and recap, before spending the rest of the day visiting the center of the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A historic castle town and city in Nagano Prefecture, &lt;strong&gt;Matsumoto&lt;/strong&gt; is known as a popular destination for those looking to visit the mountain scenery or traditional hot spring resorts located around the &lt;strong&gt;Northern Japan Alps&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Matsumoto Castle&lt;/strong&gt; in particular is a well-known attraction due to its reputation as one of the most beautiful castles in Japan. Matsumoto is the birthplace of famous artist Yayoi Kusama, and in more recent history, Matsumoto has also attracted attention for having being targeted by doomsday cult Aum Shinrikyo in 1994, leading to eight deaths by a Sarin gas terror attack.&lt;/p&gt;

Our first evening was fairly uneventful as it was too late to explore the city. We ended up joining one of the Shinshū University students for some snacks and a few drinks in a Japanese-style bar, mostly catching up on life, before calling it a day and heading towards our hostel, close to Matsumoto Castle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having met up with our professor and a KU Leuven PhD student currently doing research in Kobe University, we joined the Shinshū University group on a bus ride to our first destination, the &lt;strong&gt;Matsumoto High School Museum&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Located in an impressive forest park, &lt;strong&gt;Agatonomori Park&lt;/strong&gt; (あがたの森公園), the museum is set in the historical Matsumoto High School, a Taisho-era elite prep-school for Imperial university entrance examinations, and the only one still completely intact today. The building itself, as well as the remaining artifacts displayed throughout the museum, gave some insight in pre-war elite Japanese eduction system, and especially of note was the high levels of expertise these students had over the German language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/46925391005/in/album-72157708563856654/" title="School"&gt;&lt;img alt="School" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/46925391005_f56556819b_z.jpg" style="height:500px;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="satoyama-tunnel"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#satoyama-tunnel"&gt;Satoyama Tunnel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our next visit was to &lt;strong&gt;Satoyamabe&lt;/strong&gt; (里山辺): a guided tour through a mountain tunnel (地下壕) that our guide exapleined to be dug under horrible conditions by mainly Korean and Chinese forced laborers in the last months of the Second World War. The tour was held by a local non-profit organization called the &lt;strong&gt;Matsumoto Forced Labor Investigation Team&lt;/strong&gt; (松本強制労働調査団), who organize these tours out of the principle idea that such history too belongs to the legacy of Matsumoto, and should therefore not be erased from public memory, lest similar tendencies occur again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/46925389955/in/album-72157708563856654/" title="Mine"&gt;&lt;img alt="Mine" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/46925389955_5bdc291f93_z.jpg" style="width: 45%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="center border" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/40874942373/in/album-72157708563856654/" title="Mine"&gt;&lt;img alt="Mine" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/40874942373_11eb40eed4_z.jpg" style="width: 45%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tunnel was constructed under order &lt;strong&gt;of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. Nagoya Aviation Works&lt;/strong&gt; (三菱重工業株式会社名古屋航空製作所), whose factories were moved to Matsumoto City after an earthquake in December 1944 struck their main facilities in Nagoya. According to our guide, the company planned to built an underground plant to build parts for Mitsubishi’s successor to its Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighter aircraft, the Mitsubishi A7M Reppū (烈風).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local records of the town note approximately 7000 citizens, although official records contain only several hundred people, leaving much of Matsumoto’s wartime situation unknown. It should be noted that the billboard outside of the tunnel has been partly vandalized to hide the reference to forced labor, a topic sensitive amongst certain Japanese nationalists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="shinshu-university"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#shinshu-university"&gt;Shinshū University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Matsumoto is not a particularly large city, it is home to several universities, including Shinshū University. Founded in the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century and nowadays focusing primarily on interdisciplinary research, the university has a fairly good reputation within Japan, and offers a beautiful setting for any potential exchange student. Indeed, one of our undergraduate students studying there as a short-term exchange student, was highly enthusiastic about her experience and education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reflecting, in an ad-hoc seminar, on our brief experience with a local example of pre-war elite education, as well as but one local artifacts of daily life for forced laborers during the Second World War, we concluded our evening with an expected dinner and some drinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="matsumoto"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#matsumoto"&gt;Matsumoto&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come next day, we joined our professor for breakfast at a vegan bakery maintained by an alternative lifestyle couple he acquainted as PhD student in Tokyo. I’m hoping one day I too can have such experiences, visiting lifelong friends in Japan made during my period as student (perhaps even as PhD student) in Japan. One can dream…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/32897750337/" title="Matsumoto"&gt;&lt;img alt="Matsumoto" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/32897750337_147a583ae6_z.jpg" style="width:500px;height:281px"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After having said our goodbyes (my professor had duties in Tokyo), we headed to the nearby &lt;strong&gt;Matsumoto Folkcraft Museum&lt;/strong&gt;, which had an interesting display of Meiji and Taisho-era billboards (&lt;em&gt;kanban&lt;/em&gt;, 看板). After a brief detour to a local hot spring (my friend from Kyushu University, despite now living in Fukushima, had never had the experience), we headed to the center of the city, to &lt;strong&gt;Matsumoto Castle&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/32897751297/in/album-72157708563856654/" title="Matsumoto"&gt;&lt;img alt="Matsumoto" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/32897751297_024f5efdf3_z.jpg" style="height:500px;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Built in the late 16&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, Matsumoto Castle is one of few castles in Japan remaining almost completely intact, retaining its feudal era wooden interior rather than being rebuilt using concrete such as Osaka Castle. Designed as a fortress, much of its design caters to the use of long-range weaponry or entrapment, such as the hidden sixth floor used for unexpected attacks and hiding supplies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/47052103924/" title="Matsumoto Castle"&gt;&lt;img alt="Matsumoto Castle" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/47052103924_83b259c134_z.jpg" style="width:500px;height:281px"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea that those without a visible Asian ethnic background are able to converse in Japan is not quite widespread, especially so in more touristic areas such as, take for example, Matsumoto Castle. While reading out loud a warning sign written in Japanese (warning visitors to be careful not to hit their heads upon ascending the stairs), an elderly man working there as local guide repeated, to my amusement (and very much to my friend’s annoyance), in rather incomprehensible English (not intended negatively, his effort to cater to foreign tourists is commendable) the exact same message. Upon responding in Japanese, we were once again replied to in English. Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/46925383945/" title="Nawate-dori"&gt;&lt;img alt="Nawate-dori" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/46925383945_1d11d6f14c_z.jpg" style="width:500px;height:281px"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our final stop was the &lt;strong&gt;Nakamachi District&lt;/strong&gt; and in particular its Nawate-dōri (なわて通り), a quaint shopping street running along a river. The street is commonly known as Frog Street, selling various frog-related trinkets due its historic association with, well, frogs 🐸. The story goes that a typhoon destroyed parts of the area, leading to the local frog population seeking shelter elsewhere. A symbol of this street, citizens built a ‘frog shrine’ in hopes of the frogs’ safe return (return and frog are both pronounced &lt;em&gt;kaeru&lt;/em&gt;, 帰る and 蛙), but alas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the lack of actual living frogs, Nawate-dōri is incredibly charming and a pleasant area to spent our last hours in Matsumoto at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this year’s golden week in Japan, I joined several of my friends for a short trip to Okinawa Island, the main island of the Okinawa prefecture. Due its pleasant tropic weather and beautiful beaches at this time of the year, Okinawa is one of the more popular destinations during Golden Week, and for us too a good occasion to finally visit Japan’s tropics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id="brief-history"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#brief-history"&gt;Brief history &lt;i class="icon-history small-font"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of 47 of Japan’s prefectures, Okinawa consists of over 100 small islands located between the island of Taiwan and Kyushu. Historically, the Okinawan Islands were home to the Ryukyu Kingdom and despite strong pressure from both Japan and China maintained a certain degree of sovereignty until complete annexation during the Meiji Restoration in the late 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century. For this reason, Okinawa does feel culturally distinct to the rest of Japan even today and, based on my conversation with Okinawans, it appears many Okinawans take pride in their identity as being Okinawan first, over a national pride of being Japanese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due’s Okinawa tragic role in the Pacific War (with war casualties accounting for over a quarter of its civilian population) as well as its subsequent U.S. occupation until 1972, there is a certain animosity amongst Okinawans against both the United States and the Japanese government. That animosity is further fueled by the continuous role of Okinawa as location for U.S. military bases, hosting approximately half of US military personnel in Japan. News stories of harassment by US military, as well as rising concerns over pollution, have led to a strong politically active base and frequent protests held against the Japanese government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a more positive side, Okinawa is considered a tropical paradise and attracts tourists both Japanese and foreign. Okinawa’s population is often mentioned in international news as having long record-spanning lifespans and living healthy lifestyles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="itinerary"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#itinerary"&gt;Itinerary &lt;i class="icon-plane small-font"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We took a short local flight from Narita airport to Naha, the capital of Okinawa, followed by a convenient monorail ride directly to the city. Although we hoped to explore some of the nearby islands for scuba diving, we arrived during the rainy season and limited our activities to the main Okinawan Island. Our first days would be spent around the city of Nago, on the northern part of the island, while we’d spent the remaining days around the capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due’s Okinawa tragic role in the Pacific War (with war casualties accounting for over a quarter of its civilian population) as well as its subsequent U.S. occupation until 1972, there is a certain animosity amongst Okinawans against both the United States and the Japanese government. That animosity is further fueled by the continuous role of Okinawa as location for U.S. military bases, hosting approximately half of US military personnel in Japan. News stories of harassment by US military, as well as rising concerns over pollution, have led to a strong politically active base and frequent protests held against the Japanese government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a more positive side, Okinawa is considered a tropical paradise and attracts tourists both Japanese and foreign. Okinawa’s population is often mentioned in international news as having long record-spanning lifespans and living healthy lifestyles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="itinerary"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#itinerary"&gt;Itinerary &lt;i class="icon-plane small-font"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We took a short local flight from Narita airport to Naha, the capital of Okinawa, followed by a convenient monorail ride directly to the city. Although we hoped to explore some of the nearby islands for scuba diving, we arrived during the rainy season and limited our activities to the main Okinawan Island. Our first days would be spent around the city of Nago, on the northern part of the island, while we’d spent the remaining days around the capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nago"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#nago"&gt;Nago&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent the first night in a small vacation house close to several beaches and the city of &lt;strong&gt;Nago&lt;/strong&gt; (名護).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due the rain, we deciding on spending our first day around the &lt;strong&gt;Ocean Expo Park&lt;/strong&gt;, famous for its &lt;strong&gt;Churaumi Aquarium&lt;/strong&gt; (which held the record of largest aquarium in the world until 2005). The Kuroshiu Sea, a 35 meter long tank, is particularly impressive, hosting whale sharks as well as several large manta rays. The Park’s massive surroundings are beautiful as well and perfect for spending a day walking around at (or taking the cute shuttle buses between different attractions instead).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On our way back from the aquarium, we entered a nearby hotel, Marriott Resort, for dinner. Although reserved for guests of the hotel, we were invited to a small introduction of Okinawan dancing organized by a primary school class and their teachers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/32899412147/" title="Okinawan Dance"&gt;&lt;img alt="Okinawan Dance" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/32899412147_8979ae27bd_z.jpg" style="width:500px;height:281px"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On our second day there, a Spanish diving instructor picked us up for some lessons on surfing. After we finished changing gear, two of our friends, from mainland China, shockingly revealed they had never been in the ocean before or even had any experience swimming. Nice. Myself, I’m not particularly known for having a good sense of balance, and unsurprisingly I never actually managed to stand upright on the board for longer as several microseconds. At least I tried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="naha"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#naha"&gt;Naha&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our next two days were spent in the main capital of Okinawa, Naha. Our hostel in Naha, somewhere around &lt;strong&gt;Ebisu Street&lt;/strong&gt; (えびす通り), was located right next to a small arcade with famous ’80s and ’90s arcade games such as the Total Slug series; a steal for only 50 yen per round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/32899415027/" title="Arcade"&gt;&lt;img alt="Arcade" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/32899415027_e56f430aed_z.jpg" style="width:500px;height:281px"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In celebration of &lt;strong&gt;Children’s Day&lt;/strong&gt; (子供の日), there were various activities around Naha, including dance events at the popular central &lt;strong&gt;Kokusai Street&lt;/strong&gt; (国際通り). The Okinawan cuisine (沖縄料理) is popular all over Japan (one of my professors was particularly fond of the kitchen and during 飲み会 would often take us to his favorite Okinawan restaurant), so we spent plenty of time around trying local delicacies. Okinawan soba, Rafute and Gōyā chanpurū are some famous local dishes, and I personally loved the Beni-imo (紅芋) ice-cream. Habushu (ハブ酒), a form of Okinawan liquor (awamori) mixed with the venom of a pit viper, is often seen for sale as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another must-visit was &lt;strong&gt;Shuri Castle&lt;/strong&gt; (首里城), the historic main palace of the Ryukyu Kingdom, dating back to the early 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century. The current castle is however a reconstruction; the original was almost completely ruined after the Pacific War. Nevertheless the building is magnificent and unlike any castles I’ve seen in Japan, yet distinct enough from what I know of Chinese royal architecture of this period. The surroundings are extraordinary as well, with a stunning view on the city below and the distant sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On our last day, we visited Naha’s main beach, &lt;strong&gt;Naminoue&lt;/strong&gt; (波上). There were some festivities with local musicians as well as a large picnic co-organized by both Japanese SDF members and US military.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/40876624433/in/album-72157680389710358/" title="Okinawa"&gt;&lt;img alt="Okinawa" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/40876624433_c96930ae51_z.jpg" style="height:500px;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On our last evening, we visited &lt;strong&gt;Club Epica&lt;/strong&gt;, a nightclub in the outgoing district, specifically popular amongst foreign tourists and US military. Due the holidays, there were several dance events and concerts inside the club, spotlighting some of Okinawa’s traditions while embracing modern elements resulting in a form of psychedelic Okinawan trance musical style. We didn’t stick around too long after the events were finished, however. Unfortunately some of the military staff present were quite drunk and started harassing some of the girls around, including two girls in our group; a sober view on what for some might by daily reality in Okinawa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="music"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#music"&gt;Music &lt;i class="icon-music small-font"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While traveling, I make it a habit of finding good music by listening to local radio stations or asking recommendations to people I meet in hostels or bars, as my own form of personal souvenir. Although Okinawa is famous for ‘Queen of Japanese Pop’ Namie Amuro and musicians like Mongol800, traditional Okinawan music finds its roots in Ryukyu culture and is both melodically and aurally distinct. Although I’ve known the song for years, I have no choice but to select The Boom’s &lt;strong&gt;Shimauta&lt;/strong&gt; (島唄), as arranged by Okinawan singer Natsukawa Rimi. I had the honor of rearranging and performing this song with several classmates at the emeritus celebration of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willy_Vande_Walle"&gt;Dr. Prof. Vande Walle&lt;/a&gt;, one of my best memories as undergraduate student Japanese Studies at KU Leuven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id="conclusion"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#conclusion"&gt;Conclusion &lt;i class="icon-smile small-font"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would’ve been fun to spent some more time around the other islands near Okinawa Island, and scuba diving in Okinawan waters was something I did look forward to. Nevertheless it was a fun, relaxed trip with friends and based on dialog with local Okinawans, some readings and my own experiences there, I did to a certain degree get a bit more insight in local problems plaguing the island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an undergraduate student at my Belgian university, I took several courses related to the Korean language and Korean history, which in turn made me quite eager to visit the country, given that I’d be living relatively close for the next year and a half. During my first semester studying in Japan, I was fortunate enough to make several good friends from South Korea. One of them had already left Japan by the end of the semester, and two of friends still remaining took the academic break in March as an opportunity to return to Seoul for several weeks, inviting me as well: an excellent way of celebrating the successful completion of my first semester in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="brief-history"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#brief-history"&gt;Brief history &lt;i class="icon-history small-font"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Korea, officially known as the Republic of Korea, is an East Asian country east of Japan. Despite being sandwiched in-between China and Japan, the Korean Peninsula historically did well to repel repeated attempts of invasion and form an own distinct culture. With evidence of Korean settlements (confederacies) going back many centuries BC, and after hosting three major kingdoms (&lt;em&gt;Baekje&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Silla&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Goguryeo&lt;/em&gt;) as well as smaller confederacies for seven centuries, the peninsula first reached unification in the 7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, leading to new peaks in cultural development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent history, Japan’s victory in the 1905 Russo-Japanese War led to Japanese occupation, with official annexation in 1910; until Japan’s defeat in the Second World War. The Korean Peninsula subsequently suffered the effects of the Cold War in an ideological proxy war between the North and the South. Although an armistice has been reached, the conflict remains far from solved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The topics of Japanese occupation and war crimes remain highly sensitive and are strong political weapons amongst nationalists in both countries. Nevertheless, the steady growth of Republic of Korea’s worldwide soft power (韓流 / 한류, the Hallyu Wave) has warmed the younger Japanese generations to renewed relations with the Republic of Korea. Studying the Korean language is rapidly gaining traction, and many Japanese citizens visit the Republic of Korea for tourism or as exchange students. Likewise, under influence of decades of Japanese soft power (“Cool Japan”), Japan is an increasingly popular destination for Korean tourists and exchange students.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="itinerary"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#itinerary"&gt;Itinerary &lt;i class="icon-plane small-font"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1 id="itinerary"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#itinerary"&gt;Itinerary &lt;i class="icon-plane small-font"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When first planning my trip, I intended a fairly active trip covering Seoul, Sokcho and Busan, with a day-trip to Gapyeong. Right before departure however, my friends warned me of a sudden increase in yellow dust (PM2.5) from the Chinese mainland; it would be best to stay indoors as much as possible and make proper use of dust masks. I had never been confronted with air pollution to such an extent before, and on arrival I really was aghast. Without exaggerating at times it was difficult to see the actual color of traffic lights in front of me, and despite sufficient use of masks, I often felt sore in my throat or lungs. Needless to say, I altered my itinerary to reflect these changes and make the best of my time with my friends; centered mostly around Seoul instead, with a brief detour to the north for hiking, and to the DMZ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="seoul-hongdae-sincheon"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#seoul-hongdae-sincheon"&gt;Seoul: Hongdae &amp;amp; Sincheon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stayed in a hostel in &lt;strong&gt;Hongdae&lt;/strong&gt;, a ridiculously trendy, lively neighborhood centered around the prestigious &lt;strong&gt;Hongik art university&lt;/strong&gt;; in close vicinity to &lt;strong&gt;Ehwa Woman’s University&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Yonsei University&lt;/strong&gt;. The growth of K-pop and the idol industry, with many starting idols performing in this region, has made Hongdae famous amongst Koreans and foreign tourists alike. At night, the Hongdae public space transforms into something more suitable for wild nightlife; with many clubs and cheap bars open until early in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After dropping of my backpack, I met up with Suna, my Korean friend and &lt;em&gt;senpai&lt;/em&gt; at my Japanese university, and visited the &lt;strong&gt;Songpa&lt;/strong&gt; district, known for the &lt;strong&gt;Olympic Park&lt;/strong&gt;, the &lt;strong&gt;Lotte World&lt;/strong&gt; department complex and the nightlife district of &lt;strong&gt;Sincheon&lt;/strong&gt; (신천). As far as first impressions go, Seoul felt spacious with careful city-planning centered around accessibility. Due the air quality, the massive Lotte World Tower landmark felt quite ominous however; according to my friends it is often referred to tongue-in-cheek as &lt;strong&gt;Sauron’s Tower&lt;/strong&gt; (사우론의눈).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/47037930124/" title="Tapas"&gt;&lt;img alt="Tapas" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/47037930124_63fc0fed23_k.jpg" style="width:500px;height:281px"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After we met up with Suna’s childhood friend, we decided to have dinner in Sincheon, with my friends largely in control of the evening. They ordered a bunch of dishes I should try, and although I never actually asked for any alcohol drinks, ordered several pints of beer and a bottle of Korean &lt;em&gt;Soju&lt;/em&gt; on top. Apparently it is a common habit to pour Soju into one’s drink, known as &lt;em&gt;Somaek&lt;/em&gt; (소맥). What a way to learn new cultural traditions. Like the &lt;em&gt;izakaya&lt;/em&gt; culture of drinking and eating at Japanese pubs, it appeared quite common too in South Korea to spent the night hopping around various eateries until early in the morning, which ended up exactly how I spent my first night in South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dmz-seoul"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#dmz-seoul"&gt;DMZ &amp;amp; Seoul&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I’ve enjoyed little sleep, I had a reservation for a tour to the &lt;strong&gt;Korean Demilitarized Zone&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2" id="fnref-2" rel="footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Not a trip one does for sightseeing, a visit to the DMZ and most militarized region in the world is quite confrontational; the trip across the &lt;strong&gt;Freedom Road&lt;/strong&gt; itself, a barren landscape with the occasional military vehicle passing by, a sign for what is to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/33950201518/in/album-72157708532361014/" title="DMZ"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/33950201518_6e472210a4_k.jpg" style="width: 45%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="center border" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/46911288505/in/album-72157708532361014/" title="DMZ"&gt;&lt;img alt="DMZ" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/46911288505_7e0c95e117_k.jpg" style="width: 45%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the tour our group had the opportunity to walk through &lt;strong&gt;The Third Tunnel&lt;/strong&gt;, one of several tunnels discovered in the ‘70’s and designed by North Korea for an invasion to the south until timely discovery (although North Korea claims the opposite). The proximity of the tunnel to Munsan and Seoul shows the reality of how close both countries were to renewed conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we had a short stop at the &lt;strong&gt;Dora Observatory&lt;/strong&gt;, an observatory on the demilitarized zone and the furthest foreign tourists are allowed to go without entering the Joint Security Area. binoculars offer a view on North Korean’s so-called propaganda village as well as the city of Gaesung, but air pollution levels hindered our view this day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final stop was a visit to &lt;strong&gt;Dorasan Station&lt;/strong&gt;, passing the Unification Village. Dorasan Station is the northernmost station of South Korea and will serve as railway connecting the North and South when political relations improve. While the trip conveyed to a certain extent the tragedy of a people, families, being torn apart, I was moved by the message of hope and expectation towards future reunification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/47827449771/" title="South Korea"&gt;&lt;img alt="South Korea" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/47827449771_58a4123d64_k.jpg" style="height:500px;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after noon I met up with Hani, a close friend, classmate and colleague at my Japanese university for a visit around the historical core of the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First on the list was &lt;strong&gt;Gyeongbokgung&lt;/strong&gt;, the most famous of five Joseon-era palaces in Seoul and a stellar example of traditional Korean architectural principles and Joseon court life. Of note were both the stories of several young volunteers guiding English-speaking tourists around&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-3" id="fnref-3" rel="footnote"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and the many English-language signs around the palace detailing the Japanese assassination of Empress Myeongseong.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-4" id="fnref-4" rel="footnote"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We passed the nearby palaces of &lt;strong&gt;Changdeokgung&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Changyeonggung&lt;/strong&gt;, as well as the UNESCO designated Confucianist &lt;strong&gt;Jongmyo Shrine&lt;/strong&gt;, before reaching the beautiful housing area of &lt;strong&gt;Bukchon&lt;/strong&gt;. Still a residential area today, Bukchon is a prime example of traditional Korean houses known as &lt;em&gt;hanok&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We finished our day with a stop as the nearby &lt;strong&gt;Insa-dong&lt;/strong&gt; market street for some shopping and dinner; as well as a brisk walk around the &lt;strong&gt;Cheonggyecheon&lt;/strong&gt; creek flowing through downtown Seoul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow dust reached peak levels the following day, and thus I was forced to remain indoors for most of the day. &lt;strong&gt;The National Museum of Korea&lt;/strong&gt; was definitely a highlight however, and gave to certain degrees more context to what I had formerly been taught in Korean History and Korean Culture classes. In contrast, I must admit that the actual exhibitions held inside the &lt;strong&gt;National War Memorial&lt;/strong&gt;, specifically the English explanations, were a letdown. That is to say, I felt the narratives the exhibitions were trying to portray lacked nuance and relied heavily on simplified, patriotic good versus evil rhetoric. This of course triggers questions on the actual social function of museums or memorials, let alone one on a war that is technically still on-going. Having just visited the DMZ myself the day beforehand, I experienced strong messages of reconciliation and unification, again exemplified through the statue of two brothers outside of the War Memorial. This contrasted at times with the contradictory narratives of the exhibitions itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway. I met up with Hani again in the afternoon, shortly before she would leave to Tokyo again. We spent some time in the massive Lotte complex; which houses one of the largest permanent cinema screens in the world. We were unfortunately not able to fully enjoy said screen to its full potential; having wasted time and money on the abysmal sequel to Del Toro’s Kaiju-homage&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-5" id="fnref-5" rel="footnote"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Pacific Rim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the bad air quality, people were relatively hesitant to wear protective masks. Instead, it was more common to see young people sit outside smoking and drinking all day, without a care in the world. My friend somewhat pessimistically taught me about a popular satirical term on the South Korean Internet: &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell_Joseon"&gt;Hell Joseon&lt;/a&gt;, a term indicating the reality of South Korea’s current socioeconomic state, with many facing intense pressure to achieve, harsh working conditions and rising unemployment. At this time, a popular meme on Japanese social media portrayed working conditions for millennials in South Korea to be of such drastic levels that one will either end up collapsing of stress (&lt;em&gt;Karōshi&lt;/em&gt; 過労死) or end up working in a fried chicken store.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-5" id="fnref2-5" rel="footnote"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sokcho"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#sokcho"&gt;Sokcho&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my good Belgian friends planned a two-week trip to Seoul and Japan. After meeting up at the station, we left to &lt;strong&gt;Sokcho&lt;/strong&gt; early in the evening, hoping to spent a day trekking through the famous &lt;strong&gt;Seoraksan National Park&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/40861046573/in/album-72157708532361014/" title="Seorak-san"&gt;&lt;img alt="Seorak-san" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/40861046573_252dd39825_k.jpg" style="height:500px;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After an initial cable car ride to the &lt;strong&gt;Gwongeumseong Fortress&lt;/strong&gt;; we enjoyed more impressive views hiking to &lt;strong&gt;Ulsanbawi Rock&lt;/strong&gt; (passing the beautiful &lt;strong&gt;Sinheungsa Temple&lt;/strong&gt; on our way), tracing the &lt;strong&gt;Cheonbuldong Valley&lt;/strong&gt; trail and viewing the &lt;strong&gt;Daeseung Falls&lt;/strong&gt;. Evening fell before we realized, and the hike back was a bit difficult due the lack of light, and more worryingly, noises serving as stark reminders that we were alone in wilderness, surrounded by plenty of wildlife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="last-day"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#last-day"&gt;Last day&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sokcho is a seaside town, so how could we not spent our last hours in Sokcho visiting the local fish market? A tad overwhelming for sure, but after one of the employees saw our clueless foreign faces and helped set us up, I enjoyed by far one of the best fish-based meals I’ve ever had. I was however a bit taken aback by a cute, young Korean couple sitting near us. Reflecting the drinking culture I’ve experienced on my first night in Seoul, the couple must’ve drunken a dozen pints of beer with additional soji shots. A scene which felt rather out of place for a late-morning Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/47037933854/" title="Sokcho"&gt;&lt;img alt="Sokcho" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/47037933854_a4b2d1cdf2_k.jpg" style="height:500px;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We returned early in the afternoon, in time to meet up with Ina, my Japanese language classmate and part of my main friend circle during the first semester. While I brought my Belgian friend (who does not speak Japanese or Korean), she brought one of her friends, who speaks neither Japanese nor English. Nonetheless it was a happy reunion and after a few drinks language barriers were of little importance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it was my last day in South Korea, my Belgian friend would stay a bit longer for sightseeing. We had however, under influence of the Hallyu Wave ourselves, agreed many years ago to one day go clubbing in Seoul together. The perfect occasion to make true on that agreement, I spent my last night in Seoul with my Belgian and Korean friends enjoying Seoul’s nightlife; before heading straight to the airport next day; feeling dead, but satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="music"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#music"&gt;Music &lt;i class="icon-music small-font"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While traveling, I’ve made it habit of listening to local radio stations or ask for recommendations on any local music scene, as a form of personal souvenir. One of my Korean friends introduced me to a lot of k-pop idols and due sufficient exposure I’ve to a certain degree started to appreciate some releases. This trip was marked by GAIN’s (가인) Paradise Lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the bad timing of my visit (periods between December and March are notorious for declining air quality and a rise in PM2.5; often attributed to mainland China’s relocation of its environmentally worst offending factories west of the Korean Peninsula), I’ve had a wonderful trip. It was a joy staying in Seoul, meeting my friends and experiencing the things I’ve learned about in classrooms in real life for the first time. Furthermore, I fell in love with the Korean kitchen&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-6" id="fnref-6" rel="footnote"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and have started cooking various dishes myself afterwards. I definitely look forward to visit again and resume my original itinerary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ordering a tour in advance is the only way one can visit the area. I went with VIP Travel and would recommend that one. Due military drills it was not possible to visit the JSA, the Joint Security Area, on the border of South and North Korea. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-2" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A tragic historical event often considered as the start of contemporary anti-Japanese sentiment in Korea. Empress Myeongseong’s story has been adapted in a variety of media including an extremely popular 2001 South Korean television series. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-4" title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Japanese genre of film featuring large monsters, popularized through the Godzilla series. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-5" title="Jump back to footnote 6 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref2-5" title="Jump back to footnote 6 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-6"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seriously, while known for being rather spicy, the richness of Korean cuisine is amazing. while I definitely enjoy such dishes as Samgyeopsal (삼겹살), Bulgogi (불고기), Gimbap (김밥), Cold Noodles (Mul Naengmyeon 물 냉면), and Gogigui (고기구이), with a side serving of Kimchi (김치) or Buchimgae (부침개), my favorites are by far Dak galbi (닭갈비, quite popular on Japanese social media), Kimchi Jigae (김치찌개), Bibimbap (비빔밥) and Crispy Korean chicken (Yangnyeom tongdak, 양념통닭). For those in the Tokyo neighborhood, I recommend Shinchan (辛ちゃん) for its chicken, Shijan Dakgalbi (市場ダッカルビ) for its Cheese Dak galbi, and Saemaeul Sikdang (セマウル食堂) for Kimchi Jigae. I’ve eaten in those places more than I care to admit. Don’t forget to try the Korean sparkling rice wine makkoli (막걸리)! &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-6" title="Jump back to footnote 7 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been a while since I’ve posted my last blog, and while I’ve had some ideas on new posts, I had to prioritize schoolwork, including finishing my graduation thesis and preparing my cultural exchange. Courtesy of my university I received the opportunity to study and live in Tokyo for a year and half at Chuo University with MEXT scholarship, as part of my Master degree in Japanese Studies. I’m writing this small blog post exactly a week after arriving in Tokyo, in order to talk a bit about my university, my first impressions of my surroundings, and my personal experience with the application process for my scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id="chuo-universty"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#chuo-universty"&gt;Chuo Universty&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chuo University (中央大学) is a private-run university with several campuses spread throughout Tokyo, and containing a plethora of faculties, graduate schools and researchers. It’s mostly known for its legal studies, dating back to the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, and has many well known alumni ranging from economics and politics (including former Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu) to arts and letters (including popular director Makoto Shinkai of &lt;em&gt;Kimi no Na wa&lt;/em&gt; 君の名は。 fame).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m studying at the largest campus, Tama Campus, which is located in Hachioji: a city in the western portion of Tokyo, and about an hour by public transport to more central parts of Tokyo such as Shinjuku. As a research student I have some liberty in the classes I can take up; they’re either thematically similar to master classes of Japanese Studies at Leuven, or support the global understanding necessary to write my master thesis. Thus I’ll mostly be taking classes from the Graduate School of Letters (specifically the Socio-Informatics course) and Graduate School of Policy Studies, as well as an introduction to Japanese Law from the Graduate School of Law. If time permits, I hope to continue my Korean studies as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was pretty overwhelmed by the size of the campus. It has eleven main buildings, along with a variety of student facilities for after-school activities such as clubs (クラブ) and circles (サークル), sport rooms, several restaurants, etc. I haven’t gotten the hang of it yet and I’m sure I’ll get lost &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; over the next year and a half.

I’m pleased to see these amount of facilities available however, and I really look forward to the start of this school semester (21th of September). Although it is fairly remote (田舎), it’s definitely a beautiful, lush location, with a backdrop of mountains and forests. Finally, the food at our main school restaurant and nearby surroundings is quite diverse, tasty and incredibly cheap (approx. 300 yen or 2.5€ for a large plate of カレーライス Japanese curry? &lt;em&gt;Count me in!&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/37347700165/in/album-72157686137772481/" title="Cold Ramen"&gt;&lt;img alt="Cold Ramen" src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4333/37347700165_b13f4ea363_k.jpg" style="width:500px;height:281px"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="mext"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#mext"&gt;Mext&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was lucky enough to receive a MEXT (also known as Monbusho) Research Scholarship, offered by the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, which will cover most of my major expenses in Japan. I applied for the scholarship through university recommendation, after a new collaboration between KU Leuven and Chuo University had been made. It was a rather last minute opportunity, and I had to write my research proposal and fill out the MEXT application in a matter of days; something usually requiring weeks to months of preparing. Luckily, I had already started to prepare my research for my undergraduate thesis, and with some supports from my professors had a good idea on how to extent the scope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my application, I had to select two professors at Chuo University whose bodies of work most strongly fit how I envisioned my research. After one of them agreed to support me, we held a brief interview before I could be officially accepted. This took place about two months after my initial application, and it took another five months until I received positive news from the Japanese Ministry of Education. Finally, my status as MEXT-supported scholar is that of Research Student, rather than Japanese Studies student or Undergraduate university student, as was often the case before exchange projects at KU Leuven became part of the Master’s Degree. This status gives research students the opportunity to extend the scholarship after entering a local Graduate Degree Program or even further as PhD student.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several extensive blog posts on writing your research proposal and filling out the application. If anyone stumbled upon this blog is interested in further details on the process, feel free to leave a comment. But for now I recommend these blogs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id="logistics"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#logistics"&gt;Logistics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After an excruciating seven months of waiting, I got my confirmation and realized I’d actually be living in Japan for at least 1.5 years. As a MEXT-recipient, I discovered a great deal of work was done for me, and my application at the Japanese embassy for a student visa was accepted almost immediately, without the usual checks for solvability. Finally, matters of lodging and booking flights were swiftly dealt with by the government and university as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My flight included two pieces of baggage as well as the usual on-board bag, so I packed about 50KG worth of clothes, cooking materials, electronics, &lt;em&gt;omiyage&lt;/em&gt;, … I imagine I’ll need in my time here. Others before me have written extensively on preparing for long exchange periods, including one of my &lt;em&gt;senpai&lt;/em&gt; at my university. I’ll link them below as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financially, it’s definitely recommended to make a local bank account. Transferring money from one’s home country to Japan will be much cheaper in the long run; especially since the scholarship’s monthly stipends are deposited on a local Japan Post Office account. Similarly, I’ll also be getting a local SIM card. &lt;a href="https://tokyocheapo.com/business/internet/japan-sim-card-options-data-voice/"&gt;The internet&lt;/a&gt; taught me that data-only SIM cards for accessing 4G are fairly cheap, around 1000 - 1500 yen (approx. 9€ - 14€) on a monthly base, so this looks like the best option right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="lodging"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#lodging"&gt;Lodging&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m staying at an apartment block privately owned and refurbished by Chuo University in collaboration with other nearby universities. It is pretty small, but definitely sufficient as a student, and luxuries include my own small bathroom and kitchen area, as well as a washing machine. I’ve been using a 100-yen store to liven it up a bit (still needs some work, definitely need a microwave-oven, water cooker and rice cooker in due time).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Location wise, it’s not too shabby. It takes about 25 minutes by foot to reach my campus, and similarly it’s about 20 minutes to a central part of town called Tama Center; a very pleasant shopping district right next to an apparently famous &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanrio_Puroland"&gt;Hello Kitty themed attraction park&lt;/a&gt;. There’s supposedly held a lot of concerts and events held here, and in my first week we discovered a local festival with several live performances and an open-air theater piece. As my university is fairly remote, my apartment surroundings feel rather suburb-ish as well; but the green surroundings and lack of commuter passes make up for it, and I’m sure I’ll come to appreciate the quiet here. Reaching Shibuya however would take me approximately an hour, and set me back about 500 yen (approx. 4€) for a single trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it’s still vacation at the time of writing this, I haven’t met too many people yet; but through the various ordeals newly-arrived exchange students had to deal with (such as registering at the municipal office, sessions on emergencies and safety, …), I’ve already had a pleasant time so far. Also while heading for Shibuya this weekend to meet up with schoolmates here on holiday, I had to ask someone the road after getting lost, and randomly received a matcha bagel. &lt;em&gt;It’s the little things that count~&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having finished the final exams for my undergraduate degree in Japan Studies, we decided to spend some time off by visiting a close friend doing an internship in Seville, Spain. We used our time there to get a glimpse of beautiful Andalusia and were not disappointed by the stunning beauty of its architecture and nature, its fascinating history and, importantly, its wonderful culinary traditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="brief-history"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#brief-history"&gt;Brief history &lt;i class="icon-history small-font"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andalusia, an autonomous region at the most southward point of Spain, has had due to it’s geographical location - a gateway between Europe and Africa - strong ties with various cultures such as the Phoenicians, Greeks, Romans, Byzantines, Jews and the Muslim Moors. These cultural influences have, of course, left a strong mark on the development of Andalusia, both in its national identity and through cultural markers such as architecture, music, dance, and cuisine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="itinerary"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#itinerary"&gt;Itinerary &lt;i class="icon-plane small-font"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our friend let us stay in her apartment in Nervion, the shopping district of Seville, approximately 20 minutes by foot from the historical center. Taking her apartment as starting point, we arranged most of our activities around Seville and nearby regions. It was quite a pleasant surprise to be located only a short walk from one of the more appraised &lt;em&gt;tapa&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; restaurants in Sevilla.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent most of our time in Seville, but used a local carpooling service for two day-trips, to Granada and Ronda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seville, the capital of Andalusia and Spain’s 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; largest city, flourished in trade during the middle ages and thus has a well-developed and maintained city center. Amongst our highlights there was the 15&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century &lt;strong&gt;Cathedral of Seville&lt;/strong&gt;, the third largest church in the world, built over a late twelfth century mosque. It contains the remains of the historical controversial figure Christopher Columbus. The area around the cathedral (commonly known as the &lt;strong&gt;Jewish Quarter&lt;/strong&gt;) is considered the historical center of Seville and is a delight to stroll through with it’s small cobblestone streets and variety of boutiques and restaurants. Our friend introduced us to a small but crowded bar with late-night flamenco performances, a sure marker of the vibrant nightlife in Seville.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To us, the most impressive site was &lt;strong&gt;Réal Alcázar&lt;/strong&gt;, UNESCO World Heritage Site and palace built in Moorish architectural style across the 10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; to 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century.

It has recently gained new fame as setting of Dorne in the hit-series Game of Thrones. During our trip, we found out that a small festival of late-night concerts were held in the garden of Alcázar and promptly booked tickets. Despite spending over an hour looking for the correct entrance to the event, we were able to join one of the concerts: a performance of baroque pieces for cello, violin and organ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we visited the &lt;strong&gt;Plaza de España&lt;/strong&gt;, a plaza containing mainly government buildings designed in a variety of architectural styles, including Art Deco, Moorish and Neo-Renaissance, built over period of 15 years as a means of promoting tourism during the 1929 Expo held in Seville. The plaza has gained renewed touristic interests due to being used as set piece in the Star Wars saga.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During our trip, we met up with several local people that our friend had befriended during her stay as intern in this city. Unfortunately neither of us spoke Spanish very well, but it was still a pleasant way of learning more of Seville life and some of it’s hardships, including low wages, high unemployment, and an unbalanced ratio of man and women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/35630910381/in/album-72157683544111201/" title="Spanish Street"&gt;&lt;img alt="Spanish Street" src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4067/35374884930_3cf98c74f7_b.jpg" style="width:500px;height:281px"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="granada"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#granada"&gt;Granada&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent a day in &lt;strong&gt;Granada&lt;/strong&gt;, commuting by car using a local carpooling service. We planned on visiting &lt;strong&gt;Alhambra&lt;/strong&gt;, the Moorish famous palace and fortress complex ended up as Royal Court after the Christian Reconquista. Unfortunately due to an error, our reservation for Alhambra did not go through, but we were however still able to visit the gardens and outer areas of Alhambra, a beauty on itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/35630910381/in/album-72157683544111201/" title="Alhambra"&gt;&lt;img alt="Alhambra" src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4278/35630954991_b80e0d0738_b.jpg" style="width:500px;height:281px"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afterwards we spent the evening strolling through town and watching the sun set on Alhambra from a square on a hill. It was a pleasant experience to, after a year of learning the language, speak a few words of Korean with a Korean tourist standing next to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ronda"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#ronda"&gt;Ronda&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the aforementioned carpooling service we spent a short day in &lt;strong&gt;Ronda&lt;/strong&gt;, a small city in the province of &lt;strong&gt;Málaga&lt;/strong&gt;, situated on a canyon. We spent part of the day hiking down the canyon until we had a beautiful view on the city and it’s bridge spanning the canyon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id="music"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#music"&gt;Music &lt;i class="icon-music small-font"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When traveling, I make it a habit of finding new music by listening to local radio stations or asking recommendations to people I meet in hostels or bars - It’s my own personal souvenir and sticks better in my mind than regular touristic souvenirs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During our trip we frequently passed street musicians, most of all guitarists performing pieces in Spanish Flamenco style. My father (and as it turns out, my partner’s mother too) often played these pieces (having lived in Andalusia himself) during my childhood. Hearing these compositions once again after many years, a sense of nostalgia fell over me, and thus it felt appropriate to pick the following two compositions, &lt;strong&gt;Recuerdos de la Alhambra - &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_T%C3%A1rrega"&gt;Francisco Tárrega&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Asturias - &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Alb%C3%A9niz"&gt;Isaac Albéniz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. In my limited opinion, the following renditions have captured the precision of these pieces’ tremolo techniques perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had some misfortune during this trip, including the errors in the booking of Alhambra. The period of our journey also knew a strong heatwave that significantly worsened traveling conditions by day. Yet, the charm and beauty of the Andalusian cities we visited were undeniable. The architecture, the lovely small streets and the lush nature sure were lovely to gaze at while strolling around. But most of all, we were able to get some much-needed rest and splurged a bit on excellent food and wine - definitely a highlight of this trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During a course on classical Japanese (&lt;em&gt;kobun&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span lang="ja"&gt;古文&lt;/span&gt;) last semester, we were introduced to a particularly well-known Heian-era poem titled &lt;strong&gt;Iroha&lt;/strong&gt; – famous for using all characters of the Japanese syllabary exactly once&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attributed to &lt;em&gt;Kūkai&lt;/em&gt; (founder of the Japanese Esoteric sect of Buddhism), the layered meaning of the poem (and the fact we had to be able to recite it for my exam) struck a chord with me. I wrote a short melody to help me memorize it properly and, after my exam period, spent some time getting acquainted with electronic music composition in order to further expand upon that melody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="_1"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#_1"&gt;&lt;span lang="ja"&gt;いろは歌&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="videobox"&gt;
&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="390" mozallowfullscreen="" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xh7Nx-8-RZg" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="640"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I begin most of my compositions by playing the piano. I tried to create an otherwordly, esoteric vibe through constant shifts in modulation and relying on ninths and dissonance in the melody.

&lt;p&gt;The vocalist’s thin, airy voice works especially well for the kind of setting I hoped to express. The second half in particular used heavily distorted samples of her voice in an attempt to &lt;em&gt;derail&lt;/em&gt; and build up tension in similar fashion (hopefully) to the original poem. It also allowed me to become better acquainted with filters and techniques commonly used in electronic music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several authors debated a hidden message in the original Man’yō-gana version of the text, by putting together the last syllable of each line, which could be read as &lt;em&gt;toka [toga] nakute shisu&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;span lang="ja"&gt;咎無くて死す&lt;/span&gt;, ‘die without sin’). I tried to incorporate this in the song as some form of hidden message, using distorted whispers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the YouTube video I created a wallpaper using a photograph I once took at the grave of Tokugawa Ieyasu in Nikko. At the time of the picture, a typhoon rapidly approached our region and due to heavy rainfall, we were practically alone. Nonetheless, the storm’s influence on the ancient cryptomeria forest and the bronze urn of Tokugawa Ieyasu left for a breathtaking and very humbling sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did a bit of editing and used several free Japanese calligraphy fonts to display the contents of the poem. I found the english translation, by Esoteric Buddhist specialist Prof. Dr. Ryūichi Abe, to be particularly poetic and fitting for the kind …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">

&lt;p&gt;During a course on classical Japanese (&lt;em&gt;kobun&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span lang="ja"&gt;古文&lt;/span&gt;) last semester, we were introduced to a particularly well-known Heian-era poem titled &lt;strong&gt;Iroha&lt;/strong&gt; – famous for using all characters of the Japanese syllabary exactly once&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1" id="fnref-1" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attributed to &lt;em&gt;Kūkai&lt;/em&gt; (founder of the Japanese Esoteric sect of Buddhism), the layered meaning of the poem (and the fact we had to be able to recite it for my exam) struck a chord with me. I wrote a short melody to help me memorize it properly and, after my exam period, spent some time getting acquainted with electronic music composition in order to further expand upon that melody.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id="_1"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#_1"&gt;&lt;span lang="ja"&gt;いろは歌&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I begin most of my compositions by playing the piano. I tried to create an otherwordly, esoteric vibe through constant shifts in modulation and relying on ninths and dissonance in the melody. Once I had my base backing track done, I spread the different lines across piano, pan drum and some ambient pads, wrote a sparse drum-track using chimes, woodblocks and taiko and practically drowned the whole in reverb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://thejapanesepage.com/iroha"&gt;The Japanese Page: Iroha&lt;/a&gt;: aside from providing further insight in the history of the poem, the writer made an interesting in-depth analysis of each phrase of the poem, definitely worth reading!&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iroha uses 47 kana, without any form of voicing (&lt;em&gt;dakuten&lt;/em&gt; 濁点), of which two characters (ゐ and ゑ) are now considered archaic and obsolete. The best known example of such a pangram in English would be “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.” &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-1" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This weekend the NHK Culture Center and the Embassy of Japan in Belgium organized the 30&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; edition of the Japan Cultural Festival, held in Antwerp in celebration of 150 years of friendship between our two nations. Together with a few classmates and upper class students I had the honor and pleasure of joining this event’s staff of interpreter volunteers, spending my last 3 days assisting two incredible (and incredibly kind) artists convey their works to a large crowd of highly interested Japan aficionados.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The festival included a wide variety of exhibitions, demonstrations and performances related to Japanese artistry: dances, drum performances, calligraphy, clothing, tea ceremonies, etc. During the festival I was responsible for a stand on artistic calligraphy and a Japanese embroidery technique called &lt;em&gt;sashiko&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;span lang="ja"&gt;刺し子&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, two fields of artistry I had no prior experience in and thus learned a lot about through my interpreting those 3 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interpreting as barely just a third year student was quite an experience. The amount of technical terms related to embroidery processionally made it pretty difficult to accurately translate everything in real time but I think I somehow managed to convey the overall meaning most of the time. Something that quite surprised me was how engrossed I got in my interpreting as well as the group sense we fostered. I felt a certain sense of pride every time guests complimented on our booth’s exhibitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing that surprised me was the high interest in these art forms I originally thought maybe to be too specific to draw large crowds. Both days of the event were highly visited and left us drowned in work to the point we barely had time to eat a snack at noon. At the end everyone was exhausted, but it was definitely a good kind of exhaustion, and spending the evening together having dinner in the city center of my hometown made it all the more a pleasant memory!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, I cooperated with several other students at my music academy to write the music for a small local musical called “&lt;strong&gt;Dating&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;em&gt;a musical for the highly educated&lt;/em&gt;” (a supposedly ironic, yet pretentious title I’m less than fond of, honestly). Being slightly unsatisfied with the end-result of my own compositions, I’ve since started rearranging them. I intend to describe the process in this little blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the wings of our arrangement teacher, we collaborated with the Word &amp;amp; Song division of our music academy and the Kontich Orchestra. The W&amp;amp;S division provided the actors, came up with a general concept and devised a tentative track list as well as additional background information we were to use as guidelines in our compositions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We held frequent meetings with the Kontich Orchestra for rehearsals, further fine tuning, and to get a better feel of each musician’s capacities and the sound of their instrument. In the end, due time limits, I only contributed two songs but I’m happy to have been part of the project despite the in my opinion somewhat pretentious premise.

A couple of teenagers, obsessed with selfies and being young (the average age of the writing team was about 50 years by the way) take note of this and decide to ruin their fun by pretending to be each others date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhere near the end, things get heated up so much that a member of the audience, using classic “&lt;em&gt;breaking the fourth wall&lt;/em&gt;“&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; techniques, calls the musical to an abrupt end by spouting some idealistic wishes on the concepts of love and relationships. At this stage, &lt;strong&gt;Bacchus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Cupido&lt;/strong&gt; make their entrance in a rather absurd fashion and save the day by convincing the audience that yes, it’s important to believe in love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-banana-caves"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#the-banana-caves"&gt;The Banana Caves&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This song is played right at the start of the second half of the musical. As the cast enters the bar and spends a while having a few drinks too many before breaking out into dance, my guidelines were to create a slow “ballad” that leads into a funky second half. Unfortunately, I have no proper recordings of the actual musical, but the following track is my work-in-progress rearrangement. As I’ve yet to run it through a VST it sounds quite synthetic but I hope you enjoy it nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="videobox"&gt;
&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="390" mozallowfullscreen="" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3SRXGZui_54" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="640"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might sound silly, but I’m rather fond of videogame composer David Wise’s soundtrack to the original Donkey Kong Country games for the Super Nintendo console, games I grew up with as a kid. I tried to create a similar atmosphere in my song and named it &lt;strong&gt;The banana Caves&lt;/strong&gt; as a kind of homage. It’s basically done but the part between 3:50 and 4:00 needs some further work. :P&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="creepy-intermezzo"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#creepy-intermezzo"&gt;Creepy Intermezzo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second piece I wrote was a very last minute composition used during the intermezzo, a time when the actors needed a brief moment to rearrange the decor. I wanted to create something mysterious and film-ish to keep the audience in suspense. At the time I had been playing a lot of Erik Satie’s work and based my theme’s base on his Gnossiennes. The further arrangements were inspired by the gothic soundtrack of Coppola’s &lt;em&gt;“Bram Stoker’s Dracula”&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="videobox"&gt;

&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, I should have read the script more carefully; the particular mood I tried to convey with this track wasn’t the most suitable for the relative lighthearted musical it was meant for. I do like the piece’s main theme but I’m not satisfied with the quick ‘n dirty arrangement so I hope to start over some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s it for now! I’m in the process of rearranging and mixing several compositions in my spare time so I’ll be sure to post here when I have something new tangible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to up my Japanese pronunciation and become more fluent in Japanese text recitation, I’ve tried getting acquainted with vlogging in Japanese. I’ll (hopefully) publish weekly videos of myself narrating a newly posted news article published on one of the mainstream Japanese newspaper websites, using a classic streaming-style set-up so any potential viewer can read along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If time permits, I’ve found it a fun exercise to try and translate the article as well as create subtitles (maybe I should try fan-subbing some anime or drama one of these days, if I ever find the time, that is~).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this will become a weekly thing I won’t be posting new blog-articles for every single video I do, but feel free to follow me on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PoppeStevie"&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt; or subscribe to my &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-wW8gg1lGVn99X9ue6_eVA"&gt;YT channel&lt;/a&gt;.

Maybe it’ll happen one day (when I’m studying abroadかな～).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the academic school year rapidly approaching, we decided on a short last-minute trip abroad and booked tickets to Romania. We spent spent a week,traveling through the historic region of Transylvania, commonly associated with vampire folklore, and situated between the imposing Carpathian mountains. A rich history, ranging from a feudal agricultural culture to a post-war communist regime and following shift to a capitalist mode of production, leaves a very layered culture represented in all aspects from architecture to national mentality. This short blog covers our itinerary, with plenty of pictures to go along with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="brief-history"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#brief-history"&gt;Brief history &lt;i class="icon-history small-font"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historically, Transylvania, a traditionally more agricultural region, has been conquered by plenty of nations, including the Roman Empire, Bulgaria, Hungary, the Ottoman Empire and the Austro-Hungarian Empire until it’s disintegration following the first world war. Transylvania, as the rest of Romania, played an important role in European politics throughout the Interwar period, but suffered greatly through the second world war and the subsequent communist regime (1947 - 1989). The 1989 revolutions brought an end to Romanian Communist leader Ceausescu’s repressive regime&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and led to the implementation of the free market as well as a 2007 accession to the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of the people are ethnically Romanian, but there’s a sizable Hungarian and Roma population as well. Especially the Romani people, an ethnic minority originating from northwestern India and historically serving as slaves in Romania, undergo plenty of discrimination both in Romania and throughout Europe, thus leaving them segregated and socially vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="itinerary"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#itinerary"&gt;Itinerary &lt;i class="icon-plane small-font"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As “poor college students” without driver licenses, we relied heavily on public transport. Luckily, Romania has an excellent public transport system both within cities as throughout the country. Thus commuting through the city felt as easy as at home. Unfortunately, due to time issues, we had to cut several important destinations (such as Sighisoara) out of our trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bucharest"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#bucharest"&gt;Bucharest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We arrived in Bucharest’s Otopeni airport on the 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of September and after a brief stroll through town headed to Gara de Nord train station for a train to Sinaia. As a West-European citizen, the contrasts were a bit surprising. Balkan and Latin architectural influences contradict strongly with the tight, functional soviet designs,&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and even the more touristic access able historical center underwent heavy decay and is now mostly covered in graffiti.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, Transylvania, a traditionally more agricultural region, has been conquered by plenty of nations, including the Roman Empire, Bulgaria, Hungary, the Ottoman Empire and the Austro-Hungarian Empire until it’s disintegration following the first world war. Transylvania, as the rest of Romania, played an important role in European politics throughout the Interwar period, but suffered greatly through the second world war and the subsequent communist regime (1947 - 1989). The 1989 revolutions brought an end to Romanian Communist leader Ceausescu’s repressive regime&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1" id="fnref-1" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and led to the implementation of the free market as well as a 2007 accession to the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of the people are ethnically Romanian, but there’s a sizable Hungarian and Roma population as well. Especially the Romani people, an ethnic minority originating from northwestern India and historically serving as slaves in Romania, undergo plenty of discrimination both in Romania and throughout Europe, thus leaving them segregated and socially vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="itinerary"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#itinerary"&gt;Itinerary &lt;i class="icon-plane small-font"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As “poor college students” without driver licenses, we relied heavily on public transport. Luckily, Romania has an excellent public transport system both within cities as throughout the country. Thus commuting through the city felt as easy as at home. Unfortunately, due to time issues, we had to cut several important destinations (such as Sighisoara) out of our trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bucharest"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#bucharest"&gt;Bucharest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We arrived in Bucharest’s Otopeni airport on the 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of September and after a brief stroll through town headed to Gara de Nord train station for a train to Sinaia. As a West-European citizen, the contrasts were a bit surprising. Balkan and Latin architectural influences contradict strongly with the tight, functional soviet designs,&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2" id="fnref-2" rel="footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and even the more touristic access able historical center underwent heavy decay and is now mostly covered in graffiti.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/29865697296/in/album-72157673147829801/" title="Decayed building"&gt;&lt;img alt="Decayed building" src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8129/29865697296_916f618502.jpg" style="width: 45%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="center border" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/29606361880/in/album-72157673147829801/" title="Constructivist architecture"&gt;&lt;img alt="Constructivist architecture" src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8492/29606361880_02850fb836.jpg" style="width: 45%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sinaia"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#sinaia"&gt;Sinaia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sinaia is a quaint little town about an hour and half away from Bucharest and close to the medieval town of Brasov. As heavy focus is put on nature preservation and the weather was excellent, we spent most of our day hiking and enjoying our surroundings. We stayed the night in a cute inn near the center of the town, from where we had an excellent view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/29865657846/in/album-72157673147829801/" title="Sinaia Skyline"&gt;&lt;img alt="Sinaia Skyline" src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8385/29865657846_7b4c46bf09.jpg" style="width:500px;height:281px"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sinaia’s monastery, built in 1695, contains two courtyards churches built in Byzantine style and is lovely indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/29273564324/in/album-72157673147829801/" title="Sinaia Monastry"&gt;&lt;img alt="Sinaia Monastry" src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/6/5049/29273564324_53c1b3eac8.jpg" style="width:500px;height:281px"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearby the monastery is an impressive castle reminiscent of Disney castles. Peles Castle, built between 1875 - 1914, was designed in a neo-renaissance style combining different West-European architectural styles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/29786745922/in/album-72157673147829801/" title="Peles Castle Courtyard"&gt;&lt;img alt="Peles Castle Courtyard" src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/6/5590/29786745922_6dace29ed1.jpg" style="width: 45%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/29786748782/in/album-72157673147829801/" title="Peles Castle"&gt;&lt;img alt="Peles Castle" src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8185/29786748782_85679bba40.jpg" style="width: 45%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We suffered heavy rainfall the moment we reached the monastery, which made photography a bit more difficult (although it did add to the general atmosphere). Unfortunately the way back down took about half an hour of walking through the equivalent of a small river and left our socks in an unspeakable state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="brasov"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#brasov"&gt;Brasov&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still soaked from our earlier trip, we left for the nearby medieval mountain resort city Brasov located between the Carpathian Mountains. We booked a small apartment near the historical center for about 5€ per person/per night. The price reflects the quality pretty well. This was our front door:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/29817331051/in/album-72157673147829801/" title="Brasov appartment"&gt;&lt;img alt="Brasov appartment" src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/9/8713/29817331051_13c6cde6fd.jpg" style="width:500px;height:281px"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent the first day in this town exploring. One of the most impressive sights in this town is the so called Black Church, a large Gothic church containing one of the largest organs in Eastern Europe. Lucky for us, weekly organ concerts are held during the summer months - something I hadn’t experienced yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/29274255623/in/album-72157673147829801/" title="Brasov Skyline"&gt;&lt;img alt="Brasov Skyline" src="https://c8.staticflickr.com/9/8276/29274255623_84bfd7d8b8.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/29274259133/in/album-72157673147829801/" title="Feeding Pidgeons"&gt;&lt;img alt="Feeding Pidgeons" src="https://c6.staticflickr.com/9/8559/29274259133_fb47dc07bf.jpg" style="width: 45%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/29865663836/in/album-72157673147829801/" title="Brasov Main Square"&gt;&lt;img alt="Brasov Main Square" src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/6/5064/29865663836_4b7aca2e6c.jpg" style="width: 45%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bran-castle"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#bran-castle"&gt;Bran Castle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On our second day in Brasov, we took a short day-trip to the nearby village of Bran visiting the so-called Dracula’s Castle, an extremely imposing fortress with, despite any tangible relations with the historical figure of Vlad Tepes, a rich history nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;
&lt;a href="tps://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/29273357384/in/album-72157673147829801/" title="Bran Castle"&gt;&lt;img alt="Bran Castle" src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/8/7479/29273357384_838d4cb6c8.jpg" style="width:500px;height:281px"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/29273347754/in/album-72157673147829801/" title="Bran Castle"&gt;&lt;img alt="Bran Castle" src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8478/29273347754_329684374d.jpg" style="width: 45%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="center border" data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/29606340390/in/album-72157673147829801/" title="Bran Castle Courtyard"&gt;&lt;img alt="Bran Castle Courtyard" src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8093/29606340390_9408aede06.jpg" style="width: 45%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sibiu"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#sibiu"&gt;Sibiu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sibiu, voted European Capital of Culture in 2007, represents Transylvanian Saxon culture and has one of the few German-only schools in Romania.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We passed an orthodox church in the middle of a service and were drawn to the sound of a small orthodox choir chanting what appeared to be Russian Liturgical music. I’m not religious, but I do enjoy the ambiance of Gregorian or Russian Znamenny&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-3" id="fnref-3" rel="footnote"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; chants. Thanks to the church’s acoustics the music really came to life and made it quite a cool experience, even if I felt like an incredibly out-of-place blasphemer at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turned out September is opera month in Sibiu and this particular evening featured an opera-recital accompanied by piano and clarinet. Being a student meant we never had to pay over 2€ for any activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual, large portions of the town were covered in juvenile graffiti. One of the more interesting and politically engaged examples however, designed as modern art project, resonated with me a bit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/29900696555/in/album-72157673147829801/" title="Political engaged graffiti"&gt;&lt;img alt="Political engaged graffiti" height="281" src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/6/5209/29900696555_9bb6179321.jpg" width="500"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My GREAT_ friends a referendum will not separate us”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The historical and cultural center has plenty of noteworthy restaurants hidden in basements. We had some terrific traditional&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-4" id="fnref-4" rel="footnote"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; food at this place. It must be noted that like most things, food is incredibly cheap for western tourists, ranging around 7.5 - 10€ for a full course dinner including drinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/29817336571/in/album-72157673147829801/" title="Cavern Restaurant"&gt;&lt;img alt="Cavern Restaurant" src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/9/8044/29817336571_3aec6f254b.jpg" style="width:500px;height:281px"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ASTRA National Museum Complex is a large (one of the largest in Eastern Europe) open-air museum containing over 300 buildings in traditional Romanian folk style spread across several lakes. Unfortunately visiting at an off-season moment with bad weather meant relatively little to do, but it was worth the trip regardless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/29900697775/in/album-72157673147829801/" title="Windmills"&gt;&lt;img alt="Windmills" src="https://c8.staticflickr.com/9/8223/29900697775_ff0f786396.jpg" style="width: 45%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/29817515271/in/album-72157673147829801/" title="Astra Museum"&gt;&lt;img alt="Astra Museum" src="https://c8.staticflickr.com/9/8770/29817515271_4e136b7235.jpg" style="width: 45%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="turda-salt-mine"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#turda-salt-mine"&gt;Turda Salt Mine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Turda Salt Mine is a hidden gem for tourists visiting Romania. The city of Turda has successfully transformed one of it’s old (first mentions are dated May 1, 1271) salt mines into the equivalent of a modern attraction park, going as far as including a ferris wheel at about 50 meters down underground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deepest point, around 112 meters deep, contains an underground lake navigable by boat (one of the more memorable things I’ve done during travels so far) as well as some interesting architectural constructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/29273361754/in/album-72157673147829801/" title="Turda salt mines"&gt;&lt;img alt="Turda salt mines" src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8128/29273361754_8db14266ca.jpg" style="width:500px;height:281px"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cluj"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#cluj"&gt;Cluj&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cluj-Napoca, the second most populous city in Romania and the official capital of Transylvania, was the final point of our trip. After the Turda Salt Mine trip, we spent some time strolling around until we took a night train back to Bucharest for our early flight back to Belgium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="music"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#music"&gt;Music &lt;i class="icon-music small-font"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When traveling, I make it a habit of finding new music by listening to local radio stations or asking recommendations to people I meet in hostels or bars - It’s my own personal souvenir and sticks better in my mind than regular touristic souvenirs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This trip’s band is the Bucharest located &lt;strong&gt;Subcarpati&lt;/strong&gt;, a lovely blend of Romanian folk music and modern hip-hop beats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="videobox"&gt;
&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="390" mozallowfullscreen="" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t2IcvXBIBsg" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="640"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="conclusion"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#conclusion"&gt;Conclusion &lt;i class="icon-smile small-font"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the brief stay and relatively lousy weather we had a great time traveling around. The historic communist mode of production and the post-soviet economic problems have left their mark both geographically as socially, making for some highly interesting and contrasting views; yet some of the more rural villages feel as if they came straight out of our image of medieval fairy-tales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve never felt unsafe, despite an initial surprise in regards to the impact of ‘80’s era western media and its heavy influence in projecting eastern Europe and Soviet countries in a particular bad light. In regards to the people we talked with, there’s a strong mentality of kindness through actions over words as we’ve often noticed during moments of distress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, the food was &lt;strong&gt;terrific&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ceausescu started of as a relatively progressive Communist leader, going so far to mix North Korean Juche and Maoist concepts while dismissing aspects of soviet ideology, but steadily became more extreme, leading to an oppressive regime and heavy conflicts with Russia’s soviet reformist Mikhail Gorbachev. Interestingly, after their arrest, Ceausescu and his wife were the last people to be executed in Romania before the abolition of capital punishment. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-1" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year us second year Japanese Students were invited to participate in an international speech contest (theme: “tell an interesting story”), organized by Kobe University. Just this week we were informed that the video-recordings of those entries had been uploaded to the contest’s website and were available for all to watch.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; My story is a classic “awkward Japanese language mix-up” anecdote from a school trip to a Japanese elementary school in Brussels, which I’ll touch upon in this post, alongside the embedded video. (&lt;span lang="ja"&gt;日本の方、あまり自信がないのですが、もしよろしければ是非ともご覧ください！&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit&lt;/strong&gt;: I just found out that I somehow managed to win first prize out of all the foreign contestants!! This is so cool to hear! Thanks for the cookies, Kobe University! :D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-story"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#the-story"&gt;The story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story isn’t that interesting and a bit embarrassing, but here goes anyway!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="cookies" class="right border" src="https://steviepoppe.net/images/omoshiroi/brabo.jpg" title="cookies"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As second year students Japanese Studies, our class participated in an excursion to a Japanese elementary school in Brussels: a fun opportunity to practice our language skills as well as have some fun playing games and learn about cultural differences and customs. The event even warranted a small post on the &lt;strong&gt;JSB&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; section on &lt;a href="http://blogs.yahoo.co.jp/jsbbxl/55269213.html"&gt;yahoo.co.jp&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In advance of this trip, we split our class in several groups, each preparing a presentation or activity related to our country. Several students in our group live in Antwerp, thus we thought it fun to hold a small presentation on the famous Antwerp folklore story of &lt;em&gt;Druon Antigoon&lt;/em&gt;, an evil giant guarding a bridge and exacting an exorbitant toll of those wishing to cross. Failing to cross meant &lt;em&gt;getting your hand chopped off&lt;/em&gt; and thrown into the river.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; A tad morbid, but it worked well with a popular Belgian children’s game we thought fun to teach them, and in addition, there’s some really nice chocolate treats based on this tale we wanted to distribute afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-game"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#the-game"&gt;The game&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game is a variation of a classic tag game called “&lt;em&gt;schipper, mag ik over varen?&lt;/em&gt;” (Eng: “&lt;em&gt;Skipper, may I cross?&lt;/em&gt;”) and usually played on a school’s courtyard or in a larger PE classroom.

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year us second year Japanese Students were invited to participate in an international speech contest (theme: &amp;ldquo;tell an interesting story&amp;rdquo;), organized by Kobe University. Just this week we were informed that the video-recordings of those entries had been uploaded to the contest&amp;rsquo;s website and were available for all to watch.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1" id="fnref-1" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; My story is a classic &amp;ldquo;awkward Japanese language mix-up&amp;rdquo; anecdote from a school trip to a Japanese elementary school in Brussels, which I&amp;rsquo;ll touch upon in this post, alongside the embedded video. (&lt;span lang="ja"&gt;日本の方、あまり自信がないのですが、もしよろしければ是非ともご覧ください！&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit&lt;/strong&gt;: I just found out that I somehow managed to win first prize out of all the foreign contestants!! This is so cool to hear! Thanks for the cookies, Kobe University! :D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As second year students Japanese Studies, our class participated in an excursion to a Japanese elementary school in Brussels: a fun opportunity to practice our language skills as well as have some fun playing games and learn about cultural differences and customs. The event even warranted a small post on the &lt;strong&gt;JSB&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2" id="fnref-2" rel="footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; section on &lt;a href="http://blogs.yahoo.co.jp/jsbbxl/55269213.html"&gt;yahoo.co.jp&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-game"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#the-game"&gt;The game&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game is a variation of a classic tag game called &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;schipper, mag ik over varen?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; (Eng: &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Skipper, may I cross?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;) and usually played on a school&amp;rsquo;s courtyard or in a larger PE classroom. To play, the territory gets divided into two and the students line up on either side. One or two volunteers play the role of &amp;ldquo;skipper&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;boatman&amp;rdquo; and line up in the middle (I drew a quick MS paint diagram below, don&amp;rsquo;t judge).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="fcenter" src="https://steviepoppe.net/images/omoshiroi/skipper.png" title="skipper" alt="skipper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each round, those on the border are expected to reach the other side. Those playing the role of skipper make up a rule that has to be upheld to attain passage. Rules to pass could be anything: those wearing glasses, those skipping on one leg, etc. Not being able to uphold these rules however means running past the skipper and not being caught: if you&amp;rsquo;re tagged, you become a skipper as well. The more skippers, the more difficult the game becomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-shame"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#the-shame"&gt;The shame&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A classmate and me played the role of skipper and did pretty well making up rules in Japanese. Near the end however, I noticed several of the remaining players wearing pink pants. &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;I should definitely use this information for the next skipping rule&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;, I thought to myself. Now, the common word for pants in Japanese is ズボン (&lt;em&gt;zubon&lt;/em&gt;), probably one of the first words we learned. Except during the heat of the moment I mixed this one up with another Japanese word very similar to the English &amp;ldquo;pants&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-end"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#the-end"&gt;The end&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; Long story short, in front of not just my own teachers but all of the Japanese staff present, I asked a bunch of 12 year old girls to pass if they wore pink パンツ (&lt;em&gt;pantsu&lt;/em&gt;), a word commonly reserved for underwear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hope I won&amp;rsquo;t make that mistake again.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-4" id="fnref-4" rel="footnote"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lucky for us Antwerp citizens, a young soldier named Brabo cuts of the giant&amp;rsquo;s hand in return and casts it into the river, leaving us with some nice statues near the city square and an interesting story to tell tourists. Read more on this on &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Druon_Antigoon"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;!&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-3" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was confronted with a loud  「えええええええぇぇぇぇぇぇッ！！！」 coming from these girls&amp;rsquo; general direction.

&lt;p&gt;After a long, stressful first semester exam-period, I spent my brief time off traveling to two completely opposite places I’ve been wanting to visit for a very long time: &lt;strong&gt;Rome, Italy&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Iceland&lt;/strong&gt;: one of the coldest winter destinations I could imagine, but a place of stunning natural beauty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past years, Iceland has gained somewhat of a reputation for its hipster trends and excellent music scene (both true), but its biggest attraction to me personally remains its wild, barren landscapes: sceneries that appeared downright alien at times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What follows is our brief itinerary through this beautiful country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id="brief-history"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#brief-history"&gt;Brief history &lt;i class="icon-history small-font"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iceland, a volcanically active island close to the Arctic Circle, was first inhabited by in the 9&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century by, traditionally claimed, vikings or Norwegian settlers. Most of present-day Icelandic culture finds its roots in its Scandinavian heritage, and even now is mostly famous for its medieval sagas and traditional literature and cuisine, as well as its language closely related to Old Norse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the Icelandic plateau is one of the newest in the world, the surroundings closely resemble what our continents must’ve looked like millions of years ago. Agriculturally wise, almost everything is imported from countries as Canada, as the only native growths here are limited to bleak bushes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="itinerary"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#itinerary"&gt;Itinerary &lt;i class="icon-plane small-font"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having only a few days off in-between my exams and the start of my next semester, we were very limited in our itinerary. Even more, neither of us had a driver license at this point, so we were forced to book several tours to show us around (a thing I generally dislike, but actually ended up really pleasant). We stayed several nights in Reykjavik as day-trips to iconic views were easiest to reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="golden-circle-tour"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#golden-circle-tour"&gt;Golden Circle Tour&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On our first proper day, we took a tour leading us through the &lt;strong&gt;Golden Circle&lt;/strong&gt;, the most popular tourist route in Iceland. the host driving us around was an elderly man taking great pride in his viking roots and often talked of bygone farmer days and Icelandic folklore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On our way to our first hallmark, we encountered these beauties:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thingvellir&lt;/strong&gt;, a national mark in southwestern Iceland, lies in a valley known for its &lt;em&gt;Althing&lt;/em&gt;, the national Parliament. It was established in 930 and is generally considered as the founding point of the Icelandic nation. It held sessions until 1798, and is thus one of the longest-running parliaments in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="northern-lights"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#northern-lights"&gt;Northern Lights&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the evening, we took a bus to a more desolate spot outside of the city and waited for polar activity. We were extremely lucky to have a clear sky in this period (heavy snowstorms hit Iceland shortly before our arrival as well as on our last day) and after a few hours of waiting were graced with &lt;em&gt;ghostly green shimmmers dancing in the dark&lt;/em&gt; (excuse my attempt at sounding poetic). Alas my camera was not strong enough to record any of this, so you’ll just have to take my word for it’s magic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day, we took another tour driving us around several other landmarks, including the famous volcano Eyjafjallajokull which erupted in 2010. Our host, an extremely pragmatic man, felt no need to recite nostalgic childhood memories and instead informed us on current-day issues such as the economic crisis, the political system and farmers’ daily lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fans of Game of Thrones might recognize &lt;strong&gt;Vatnajökull&lt;/strong&gt;, the largest ice cap in Iceland, as a scene in the series’ second season. The barren surroundings contrasted strongly with the bright, blue reflection of the enormous mass of ice in front of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="black-sea"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#black-sea"&gt;Black Sea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our last stop was the &lt;strong&gt;Reynisfjara shore&lt;/strong&gt;, a black pebble beach near an impressive cliff. A snowstorm hit us around this period and walking around was extremely difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent one day walking around Iceland’s capital, a city with a population of around 130,000. Bearded men walk around wearing lumberjack shirts in the middle of the winter, and blend in well with the picturesque and colourful houses as well as the various boutiques and stores that could only be referred to as being hipster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We visited spots as the Reykjavik Concert &amp;amp; Conference Center, known for its beautiful glass architecture, and the Church of Hallgrimur, the largest church in Iceland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/30483921506/in/album-72157672690983682/" title="Reykjavik Church"&gt;&lt;img alt="Reykjavik Church" src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/6/5520/30483921506_4d4844ee96.jpg" style="height:50%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had some great food and shopping around this place, but by the time we were ready to depart to our final destination, another heavy snowstorm made its appearance. Thanks to a kind by-passer we reached our bus-stop in time for a drive to Kevlavik, a small village close by the airport. As our airplane left quite early the next morning, we felt it’d be safest to spend our night nearby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="kevlavik"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#kevlavik"&gt;Kevlavik&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, our bus stop was pretty far from our actual destination, and as Kevlavik was formed around and out-of-use military base, nothing really stood out as bed &amp;amp; breakfast kind of place. By this time, the storm reached a peak with winds reading over 80KM per hour, and walking through either 30cCMof snow or slippery ice made this an impossible feat, especially since we were all by ourselves. At one point we were literally clinging to the pole of a traffic light for approximately 10 minutes (felt longer) until a car passing by was kind enough to give us a ride to our B&amp;amp;B. Safe to say, we didn’t go out again for sightseeing that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="music"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#music"&gt;Music &lt;i class="icon-music small-font"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When traveling, I make it a habit of finding new music by listening to local radio stations or asking recommendations to people I meet in hostels or bars - It’s my own personal souvenir and sticks better in my mind than regular touristic souvenirs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite a relatively small population, Iceland (particularly Reykjavik) is well known for having an excellent music scene, with such world-class acts as &lt;em&gt;Bjork&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Sigur Ros&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Of Monsters and Men&lt;/em&gt;. I came across this trip’s band, &lt;strong&gt;Kiasmos&lt;/strong&gt;, while visiting a bookstore and swiftly fell in love with the duo’s  experimental, almost drone-like ambient electronic music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="videobox"&gt;
&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="390" mozallowfullscreen="" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jGQn3xHQz0s" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="640"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the duo’s members, &lt;strong&gt;Ólafur Arnalds&lt;/strong&gt;, has already built a name for himself mixing his classical piano background with electronic influences and is definitely one to remember as well!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="conclusion"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#conclusion"&gt;Conclusion &lt;i class="icon-smile small-font"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a shame we had such a short stay, as Iceland came over as a beautiful country unlike any other, with a rich and fascinating history and splendid alien-like landmarks. Our personal biggest drawbacks were a lack of money and driving licenses; I would definitely return if neither of these formed a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a long, stressful first semester exam-period, I spent my brief time off traveling to two completely opposite places I’ve been wanting to visit for a very long time: Iceland and the historic city of Rome, Italy, cradle to one of the most well-documented civilizations in western history. In order to recharge our batteries, we decided on this 4-day city trip and, looking back, it really did turn out to be a city that could only be described as a living, breathing open-air museum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What follows is our brief itinerary through this charming city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id="brief-history"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#brief-history"&gt;Brief history &lt;i class="icon-history small-font"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where does one start! Rome, Italy’s capital and largest city, has been an extremely influential city for nearly three-thousand years. What is now a global city popular for it’s fashion and design was once a small village on top of a hill that through a series of fascinating military and political events became center of a vast empire and location of Catholicism’s founding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plenty of historical locations have been destroyed following Italy’s rise of Fascism and role in the second World War, but the historic center (Unesco World Heritage) remains as if untouched by time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="itinerary"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#itinerary"&gt;Itinerary &lt;i class="icon-plane small-font"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having limited time, we spent all our time exploring the historical center of Rome and the Vatican. We spent three nights in a lovely bed &amp;amp; breakfast around 15 minutes away from the historical center; which was, due being located in what might might be perceived as a shabby neighborhood, extremely well priced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-1"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#day-1"&gt;Day 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent our first day strolling around the city’s historical center and experiencing some of the more popular destinations such as the famous &lt;strong&gt;Spanish Steps&lt;/strong&gt; square and &lt;strong&gt;Trevi Fountain&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/29548322602/in/album-72157672616633970/" title="Street to Spanish Steps"&gt;&lt;img "="" alt="Street to Spanish Steps" src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8766/29548322602_8d9fa0e2c2_b.jpg" style="height:500px;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As fans of English Romanticism (including poets as &lt;em&gt;Byron&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Shelly&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Keats&lt;/em&gt; we spent a bit of time in what is now a museum dedicated to Keats: the &lt;strong&gt;Keats-Shelley Memorial House museum&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/29032997714/in/album-72157672616633970/" title="Rome Skyline"&gt;&lt;img alt="Rome Skyline" src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/9/8470/29034772843_795100ab25_b.jpg" style="width:500px;height:281px"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We concluded our evening having the most classic dinner one might expect of tourists in Italy: pizza and tiramissu (no regrets).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-2"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#day-2"&gt;Day 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our second day was mostly centered around Rome’s ancient &lt;strong&gt;Colosseum&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Palatine Hill&lt;/strong&gt; and the massive &lt;strong&gt;Roman Forum&lt;/strong&gt;. Beautiful ruins rich in history made this area an unforgettable experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out this area is popular amongst conservatory students as well. Excellent, sunny weather (in the middle of winter!) and a classical violist nearby reciting Vivaldi made for a lovely picnic~.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later in the evening we visited the &lt;strong&gt;Pantheon&lt;/strong&gt;, a basilica dating back to 27 BCE, and architecturally quite impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-3"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#day-3"&gt;Day 3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our third day was mostly focused on the &lt;strong&gt;Borghese Gardens&lt;/strong&gt; (we ended up renting a rowing boat!) and its excellent art museum including works of &lt;em&gt;Bernini&lt;/em&gt;. Turns out ordering a chocolate milk in Rome will net you a solid chocomousse-like dessert. Cultural differences!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/29548321492/in/album-72157672616633970/" title="Fairytale cottage"&gt;&lt;img alt="Fairytale cottage" src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8366/29548321492_f9fde645fe_b.jpg" style="width:500px;height:281px"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-4"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#day-4"&gt;Day 4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our fourth and last day, a Sunday, was an excellent time to visit the &lt;strong&gt;Vatican City&lt;/strong&gt; and gain a potential bar-bragging story by experiencing a Pope Francis speech live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Sistine Chapel&lt;/strong&gt;‘s queues are legendary and despite being out of season, today was not an exception. We could’ve easily queued for 4 hours so we wisely decided on admiring &lt;strong&gt;St. Peter’s Basilica&lt;/strong&gt; instead. I’m not religious, but the general atmosphere in Vatican City was quite enjoyable and reminiscent of that often felt at music festivals: a small band was performing live music while an enormous crowd, including a surprising amount of young people, lined up to see the Pope’s speech. Not speaking Italian or being religious made me feel slightly out of place however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id="music"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#music"&gt;Music &lt;i class="icon-music small-font"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When traveling, I make it a habit of finding new music by listening to local radio stations or asking recommendations to people I meet in hostels or bars - It’s my own personal souvenir and sticks better in my mind than regular touristic souvenirs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This trip’s band is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zu_(band)"&gt;Zu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, an experimental band hailing from Rome and often defined as being a mix of &lt;em&gt;dark jazz&lt;/em&gt; (whatever that might be~), math rock and noise. It’s definitely not an easy listen, but highly atmospheric and I’ve grown surprisingly fond of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following song is a collaboration with fellow noise-jazz band &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Il_Teatro_degli_Orrori"&gt;Il Teatro Degli orrori&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id="conclusion"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#conclusion"&gt;Conclusion &lt;i class="icon-smile small-font"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calling Rome a living, breathing open-air museum is certainly no overstatement. One might wander for hours through the historical center’s alleys and side streets and still discover new beautiful sightings and hidden surprises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Italian food is famous across the world and rightly so. Restaurants in the historical center are generally considered tourist traps, but just a few minutes of extra walking took us to great, affordable destinations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, and this is probably accountable for traveling out of season but despite being such a popular destination we’ve hardly ever felt overcrowded or had shady figures approaching us at touristic viewpoints, as we’ve experienced in places as London or Paris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, Rome ended up a perfect romantic city-trip destination and highly affordable even for the poor students amongst us! We spent four days, which felt fine enough, but we could’ve easily stayed longer and still discover plenty more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, me and a couple of friends decided on a summer road-trip throughout the so-called &lt;em&gt;Deep South&lt;/em&gt;, the most southern states of the USA. As we have a shared history of playing in bands and writing music together, my friends and I thought it would be cool to purchase some second-hand instruments and travel through some of the more musically well-known states. This short blog covers our three-week itinerary, with plenty of pictures to go along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id="brief-history"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#brief-history"&gt;Brief history &lt;i class="icon-history small-font"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Deep South refers to the seven slave states that originally joined forces in what became known as the Confederate States of America. The historical dependence on slave labor (as well as the proximity to Cuba and Mexico) means that the region has both a large present-day ethnic minority of African-Americans and Hispanic Americans (and a more apparent cultural mix). Therefore, parts of this particular region are also informally called Black Belt (as well as Bible Belt). Simultaneously the region politically tends to be more conservative-leaning; with historic revisionism in regards to the region’s role in, and dependence on, trans-Atlantic slavery often neglected in favor of ‘State rights’ rhetoric.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="itinerary"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#itinerary"&gt;Itinerary &lt;i class="icon-plane small-font"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We rented a relatively cheap car that would still be large enough to handle all five of us and our gear. Size-wise The car looked like a limousine, yet  paled in comparison to the cars driving around us; among our first cultural shocks right there. As most of us are still students, we left straight after our finals end of June. The summertime in the South is described as being relentlessly tough, so we made sure to have proper air-conditioning and plenty of water available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="car" class="fcenter" src="https://steviepoppe.net/images/car.jpg" title="car"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="miami"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#miami"&gt;Miami&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a fairly pleasant eight-hour flight, we arrived at Miami International Airport in Florida. Despite arriving late in the evening, it still took us over a whopping three hours of queuing just to get through border control. It was a Kafkaesque experience for sure; having to queue to use check-in machines and manual check-ups serving the exact same task, yet those manual check-ups were so superficial that it felt entirely unnecessary and a waste of time. An antiqued relic of post-911 measures?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On our way out we passed about five fast-food chains within a minute of driving, as well as several drive-through gun shops and pharmacies, and big billboards advertising triple-bypasses. What a country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our way out we passed about five fast-food chains within a minute of driving, as well as several drive-through gun shops and pharmacies, and big billboards advertising triple-bypasses. What a country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/29035300123/in/album-72157672692229522/" title="Miami"&gt;&lt;img alt="Miami" src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/9/8094/29035300123_8272e91fed.jpg" style="width:500px;height:281px"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some other memorable locations to us as foreigners around here were a Waffle House and an enormous Walmart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="everglades"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#everglades"&gt;Everglades&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent some time exploring the everglades, a natural region of tropical wetlands with a large variety of flora and fauna. After passing an alligator crossing the road, we decided to stay in our car for most of the time here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/29660058475/in/album-72157672692229522/" title="Desolate Road"&gt;&lt;img alt="Desolate Road" src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/9/8235/29660058475_c9f48d8955.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="key-west"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#key-west"&gt;Key West&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Key West is the most southern island of the Florida Keys as well as the most southern city in the USA. The area has strong Cuban influence and is generally known as a tropic nightlife paradise. We spent some time at one of the beaches but found the area too crowded to our liking. People were pleasant and talkative enough around here, although the constant witty banter and one-liners (what we had thus-far only experiences in US television shows) became tiring rather quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/29035319323/in/album-72157672692229522/" title="Key West"&gt;&lt;img alt="Key West" src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/9/8184/29035319323_d2a5c1c4d6.jpg" style="width:500px;height:281px"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="panama-city-beach"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#panama-city-beach"&gt;Panama City Beach&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a long, intense drive, we halted in panama City Beach and spent the afternoon and evening in a natural park, playing a bit on our instruments and having some drinks. Only at this point did we fully realize cities in the USA often don’t have city centers similar to the German city-model popular in Europe. Thus we could never just park our car somewhere and spend the day just walking around or travel by public transport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the upcoming presidential elections most people we met were incredibly keen on talking politics. In this natural park, we met an elderly man who (after inviting us for a pick-nick with his family) tried to convince us that President Obama was a actually a radical leftist Muslim destroying the United States with his socialist plans and support for Muslim terrorists. The kind of politics you might end up taking for granted when relying on private-owned, heavily sponsored news channels such as Fox News too much. It was for that exact reason, actually, that he would support Trump in the upcoming elections (notwithstanding that isn’t actually running).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a mixed experience; while the family was open and kind (to all colors and races, as he was keen on highlighting by pointing out his daughter’s marriage to a Black man, both present at the pick-nick), it was clear that the lack of self-confidence in their Southern identity (these regions are often the butt of the joke) might have further marginalized and radicalized them politically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="alabama"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#alabama"&gt;Alabama&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a long drive through the scenic beauty of Alabama, we spent a short night in major port city &lt;strong&gt;Mobile&lt;/strong&gt;. I particularly enjoyed the thick accents spoken here, reminding me heavily of the 1994 movie &lt;em&gt;Forrest Gump&lt;/em&gt;, which takes place around this area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="louisiana"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#louisiana"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Louisiana was one of the more interesting states we visited, with a strong &lt;em&gt;Cajun&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Creole&lt;/em&gt; influence present in both cuisine and culture. It is unfortunate that after eleven years, the scars caused by the notorious Hurricane Katrina are very much visible and unresolved. A blight on a nation that takes pride in its wealth and strong economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lafayette"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#lafayette"&gt;Lafayette&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lafayette is a pretty small town with a lively outgoing scene. After some detours we ended up in a local bar filled with burly, tattooed bikers watching several Americana performers. This was a really cool, unplanned experience and the whole thing really felt like a scene straight out of popular Southern Vampire series True Blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We befriended a young couple, both fresh college graduates and strong Bernie supports. It was a lovely and enriching experience, albeit that my worries on the marginalization of this region were further confirmed through the somewhat condescending tone used in regards to the US south as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="new-orleans"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#new-orleans"&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/29914947635/in/album-72157672692229522/" title="New Orleans"&gt;&lt;img alt="New Orleans" src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/6/5563/29914947635_2ec9c8dcaa.jpg" style="width:500px;height:281px"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Orleans is popularly referred to as the birthplace of jazz music in the USA and thus couldn’t possibly be left out of our itinerary. We checked-in close to the famous &lt;strong&gt;French Quarter&lt;/strong&gt; and spent our first night in bars around &lt;strong&gt;Bourbon Street&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As first impressions go, that one was actually a bit of a downer. Bourbon Street reminded me of a sleazy red-light district overrun by affluent, middle-age tourists, and the smell was unbearably nauseating, reminding us of a mixture of sewer and cannabis. In hindsight this should have made sense; historically parts of the French Quarter did serve as a red-light district, after all, and was popular for drinking, gambling and brothels. The next evenings, however, were spent in nearby streets instead and surely ended up more memorable; having been treated to impromptu jazz concerts and street hip-hop free-styling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Orleans, as most of Louisiana, is often depicted as having a strong Voodoo culture amongst its creole population (descendants of French or Spanish colonial settlers, often with African or Native American ancestry as well). One of the famous practitioners, Marie Laveau, is buried in New Orleans; her grave becoming a famous tourist attraction. Frankly, the idea of a voodoo culture felt extremely commodified and exploitative; and someone we met of Creole descent did in fact argue that due to gentrification, very little of actual Creole voodoo culture remains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/29035311123/in/album-72157672692229522/" title="Swamps"&gt;&lt;img alt="Swamps" src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/9/8313/29035311123_5dd636dd0f.jpg" style="width:500px;height:281px"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Orleans has plenty of swamps and bayous and a boat-tour through them was quite lovely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/29578562421/in/album-72157672692229522/" title="Swamps"&gt;&lt;img alt="Swamps" src="https://c6.staticflickr.com/9/8434/29578562421_1520b0d034.jpg" style="width: 45%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="texas"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#texas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Texas, the second largest state in the USA and bordered by Mexico, has a long and politically colorful history culminating in the narrative of being strong-willed and independent. After days spent driving on gray, asphalt roads, the rough, desert-like setting was quite a change. We thoroughly enjoyed our in this state and extended our stay by almost a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/29578566761/in/album-72157672692229522/" title="Texas"&gt;&lt;img alt="Texas" src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8117/29578566761_ac3e724808.jpg" style="width:500px;height:281px"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="houston"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#houston"&gt;Houston&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On our way to the state capital, we passed through Texas’ largest city and home of &lt;strong&gt;NASA’s Mission Control Center&lt;/strong&gt;. A visit was definitely compulsory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/29831503681/in/album-72157672692229522/" title="Space Station"&gt;&lt;img alt="Space Station" src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8379/29831503681_e7e7e634f3.jpg" style="width:500px;height:281px"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around this exact time several violent protests broke out following the shooting of an unarmed black man by a police man in Houston, followed later by the shooting of several police officers. Even in our home country we often hear reports of police brutality and racial conflicts in the USA, but actually experiencing the tense atmosphere and intense sadness following these events is an entirely other thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="austin"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#austin"&gt;Austin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="center border"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147061735@N04/29578569271/in/album-72157672692229522/" title="Austin Skyline"&gt;&lt;img alt="Austin Skyline" src="https://c8.staticflickr.com/9/8419/29578569271_d99c12b144.jpg" style="width:500px;height:281px"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having heard that Austin is within Texas known for being a more liberal and alternative city with a large college student population, we decided on spending the fourth of July and following weekend there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something bizarre: the majority of the bars around there had Jenga games on their terraces. On a particular night, me and two others were on a roll and built a rather large tower, to the point some bystanders started filming and taking pictures. Several time that evening we were approached as “Oh dude you’re the Jenga boys, right?” - Which was frankly not the reputation we were hoping for, if anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We befriended a local guy of Mexican descent and had a few more drinks at our place afterwards. Again the topic shifted towards politics; with his strong libertarian mindset ultimately opting to vote for Trump in hopes that it would increase state independence. Wonder how that will play out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of our best meals was spent at a family-style barbecue restaurant nearby Texas, The Salt Lick BBQ, which we had already heard about before our trip after it went viral on the internet for their specific style of cooking. Another good memory food-wise was a Korean BBQ in the center of Austin. Not exactly very American, but I finally understand the hype.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="big-bend-national-park"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#big-bend-national-park"&gt;Big Bend National Park&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite apparently being relatively unknown, Big Bend National Park turned out to be the most breathtaking place we’ve visited in the US. Lying directly on the border of Mexico, the area has a distinct desert-like environment with appropriate flora and fauna. We often passed snakes, lizards and scorpions, as well various spiders and insects I’d rather avoid altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="nashville-tennessee"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#nashville-tennessee"&gt;Nashville, Tennessee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nashville, the capital of Tennessee is well known as the center of the country music industry in the USA and saw the birth of famous musicians such as Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson and Roy Orbison (and in more recent memory Miley Cyrus).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent some time on &lt;strong&gt;Broadway Street&lt;/strong&gt;, popular for bar hopping (or “honky-tonking”) along various country-music venues. It’s a pretty touristic place (and we actually passed the notorious far-right Dutch politician Geert Wilders).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some locals drove us to &lt;strong&gt;5-point&lt;/strong&gt;, the local outgoing district with a vibrant nightlife. Two guys we acquainted at one bar again ended up preaching the necessity of gun-rights and in particular the right to open or concealed carrying. For sure another heavy culture shock right there, given that we have very strict gun laws in Belgium, but they took us for a few rounds at a nearby shooting range the next day, which was an interesting, unplanned experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id="music"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#music"&gt;Music &lt;i class="icon-music small-font"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When traveling, I make it a habit of finding new music by listening to local radio stations or asking recommendations to people I meet in hostels or bars - It’s my own personal souvenir and sticks better in my mind than regular touristic souvenirs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This trip’s pick is the Nashville-born &lt;strong&gt;Hank Williams III&lt;/strong&gt;, a multi-instrumentalist and grandson of famous honky-tonk / country musician Hank Williams. He successfully blends his country and honky-tonk roots with punk-rock and metal, and we’ve often played his albums on our trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="conclusion"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#conclusion"&gt;Conclusion &lt;i class="icon-smile small-font"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A first surprise was the enormous influence of American pop-culture and soft-power on our daily lives: upon arrival I felt this sense of nostalgia despite having never visited the place before. Yet even more surprising was the spatial planning in these states: we’ve had occasions of staying at a certain hotel with a particular lay-out and a range of fixed fast-food chains nearby; getting up at 7AM and driving over 14 hours across concrete roads, only to arrive at the exact same hotel with the exact same fast-food chains nearby again. Genuinely felt like parts were constructed through the usage of copy-paste in a large Sims game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public transport, especially interstate-wise, is incredibly lacking. The young couple we talked to told us the car-industry successful lobbied against Obama’s plan to introduce a European-style train-network. Furthermore, the outrageous amount of advertisements and national flags as signifiers of national identity visible everywhere we went would have been outright bizarre if we were not yet aware of rather nationalistic tendencies in US history and education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless it was an enjoyable trip, although not without a variety of culture shocks. We achieved our goals of playing music on the road, and most of our evenings were spent socializing with locals or listening to local bands perform. People were generally incredibly warm and interested and often invited us over for dinner or drinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of which, I probably gained over ten pounds eating hamburgers, BBQ and various kinds of fried food. Wonder how I’d look if I had a longer stay.&lt;/p&gt;
